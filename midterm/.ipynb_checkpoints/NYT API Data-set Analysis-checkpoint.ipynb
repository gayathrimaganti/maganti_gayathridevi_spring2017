    "- You would need to create an API key.\n",
    "- Use `request` or `beautiful-soap` library to download the data. (No other library or crawler allowed).\n",
    "- Store the data in your local machine.\n",
    "- Your analysis should use **this downloaded data only** (and not try to redownload this data again during analysis time).\n",
    "- There is a rate limit for downloading the data. I would suggest you to start collecting the data from day 1. You can try  \n",
    "  using multiple account to get more than 1 key.\n",
    "- You need to use atleast 2 API method eg: `archive`, `Article Search`. **Do not use** `Movies Review`, `Semantic` API.\n",

    "- You need to submit a `runnable ipython notebook`. TA should be able to clone your repository and run the code in their \n",
    "  machine. (They will install any libraries you have as well as set-up any environment variable and file argument that you have  \n",
    "  need.) But there should be no code change required to run the notebook.\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any python libraries except **Numpy,Pandas,automated crawler tools**. You can use a library for  \n",
    "  crawling (if you think you need it but it should not be an automated click to run types.)\n",
    "- Do not share/upload any keys on Github. You should store them as environment variable.\n",
