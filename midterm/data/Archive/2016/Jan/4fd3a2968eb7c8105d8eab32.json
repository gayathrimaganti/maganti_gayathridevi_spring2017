Inserting a mix of what Tisci named \"American 1950s housewife\" and \"French '70s style\" into \"the best of our men's, women's and couture,\" he delivered a look that is all tough and refined and, literally, ready to wear now and for seasons to come. Hits include pieces featuring a subtle paillette print, a herringbone and cashmere suit, wool jackets stiffened with men's fabrications, then wrapped in places with the softest organza, and this expertly tailored croc-trimmed tuxedo. Worth noting also are the collection's elongating boots, furry baseball caps and sharp talon ear studs (see: editors swooning).", "headline": {"main": "Just One Look | Givenchy", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2968eb7c8105d8eab32", "word_count": 115, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T10:30:52Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Givenchy", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
