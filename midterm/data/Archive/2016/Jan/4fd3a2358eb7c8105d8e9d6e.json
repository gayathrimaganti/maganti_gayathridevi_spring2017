In a statement on Tuesday, the association for nonfiction film - which sponsors an annual DocuWeeks program that has qualified documentaries as Oscar submissions by putting them in theaters, but often without getting the requisite review - said the new rules \"will certainly have an impact\" on its screening program. But that impact, it said, wouldn't be clear until both the Academy and the editorial staffs of the two newspapers provided more information.", "headline": {"main": "New Documentary Rules Will Affect DocuWeeks, Group Says", "kicker": "Carpetbagger"}, "_id": "4fd3a2358eb7c8105d8e9d6e", "word_count": 152, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T13:00:25Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
