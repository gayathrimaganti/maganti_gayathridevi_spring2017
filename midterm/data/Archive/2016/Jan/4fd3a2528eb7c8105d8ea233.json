The company announced on Tuesday that it would present the complete Wagner \"Ring\" cycle that it had commissioned with the San Francisco Opera but suspended because of money problems. The Washington company, whose merger with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was announced a year ago, ended up presenting the final installment, \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung,\" only in a concert performance in 2009 after individual productions of the first three operas in previous seasons. It had halted plans for a presentation of the complete cycle, which San Francisco staged last June.", "headline": {"main": "Washington National Opera to Present 'Ring' Cycle in 2016", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2528eb7c8105d8ea233", "word_count": 201, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T16:23:36Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Washington National Opera", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Kennedy, John F, Center for the Performing Arts", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
