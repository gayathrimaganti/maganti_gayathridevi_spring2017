Yes, Alabama took all the drama out of who should be No. 1 with its 21-0 victory over thought-to-be-unbeatable Louisiana State Monday night, but what a small victory that turned out to be. It capped the year of Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno's fall, of Ohio State's probation forming the other big rapids in a raging river of ethical failures and misplaced priorities. It came at the end of a string of uninspired, made-for-bad-TV bowls, played so far after the season ended that even the major players needed name tags. And the finale was a conference rematch about as attractive as a Kris Humphries-Kim Kardashian reunion.", "headline": {"main": "Leading Off: Bad Season Ends Worse", "kicker": "The Quad"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e88eb7c8105d8eb7ae", "word_count": 745, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T10:41:40Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "College Athletics", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "McDaniels, Josh", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Ohio State University", "rank": "21"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Coaches and Managers", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Football League", "rank": "19"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "New England Patriots", "rank": "20"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Larkin, Barry", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "University of Alabama", "rank": "23"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Crennel, Romeo", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Collegiate Athletic Assn", "rank": "18"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Louisiana State University", "rank": "17"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Southeastern Conference", "rank": "22"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Kansas City Chiefs", "rank": "16"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Miles, Les", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Green Bay Packers", "rank": "15"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Paterno, Joe", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Denver Broncos", "rank": "14"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Pioli, Scott", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Bowl Championship Series", "rank": "13"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Richardson, Trent", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Saban, Nick", "rank": "9"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Playoff Games", "rank": "12"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
