Not long after, Mr. Stoll, best known from his role as the bald detective on the short-lived \"Law & Order: Los Angeles,\" was called in to see Mr. Allen about a part in \"Midnight in Paris.\" He was duly petrified but wound up with the role of Hemingway. He donned a wig and a mustache, and on screen he was one of the most memorable stars in a cast that included Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard.", "headline": {"main": "A Role That Was Good and True and Stole the Scene", "kicker": "Carpetbagger"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e88eb7c8105d8eb7a0", "word_count": 182, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-05T14:43:51Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Johansson, Scarlett", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Cotillard, Marion", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Allen, Woody", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Wilson, Owen", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Movies", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
