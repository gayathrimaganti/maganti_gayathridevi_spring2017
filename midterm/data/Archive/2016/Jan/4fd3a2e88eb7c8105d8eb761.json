The name says it all, according to Toyota: FR-S stands for \"front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, sport.\" The 2-plus-2 coupe measures nearly a foot longer than a Corolla and carries decidedly sportier pretensions. Its Toyota-branded equivalent, the FT, was displayed at the Tokyo auto show in December, but Toyota clearly wants Scion to get a dose of performance cred, which was previously available only from the tC.
