The show opened on Dec. 14 to a mix of positive and negative reviews from critics, and it failed to develop a following despite the relative lack of new original musicals on Broadway last fall, with some ticket sales agents saying that the title - a modern-day twist on the classic Greek play - was off-putting to some potential theatergoers and tourist groups. (The only other original musical to open on Broadway during the fall season, \"Bonnie & Clyde,\" received worse reviews and closed on Friday.)", "headline": {"main": "'Lysistrata Jones' to Close", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2a48eb7c8105d8ead4d", "word_count": 221, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-03T17:49:33Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
