There are at least 30 carriages, theatrical re-enactments, dancers, musicians, jugglers, street performers, royal pages, giant puppets and many other entertaining characters.According to the Bible, at this time of year, three wise and powerful kings brought gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the infant Jesus. To celebrate the occasion, on Jan. 5, children in Spain go to bed early, awaiting the morning, when they hope to find the presents that they requested of the three kings in letters written on Boxing Day, Dec. 26. They leave shoes on windowsills or balconies or under the Christmas tree to be filled with toys.", "headline": {"main": "Madrid to Celebrate Three Kings, and the Gift of Innocence", "kicker": "In Transit"}, "_id": "4fd3a2858eb7c8105d8ea974", "word_count": 232, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-01T06:00:39Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Spain", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Travel and Vacations", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
