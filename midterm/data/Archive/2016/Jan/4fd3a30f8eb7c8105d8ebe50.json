Martin wrote about (and discusses in this video) the state's attorney's office in Lake County, Ill., and their novel theories to explain away exculpatory DNA evidence in Rivera's case and others. Michael Mermel, the prosecutor quoted extensively in Martin's article, was asked in early December to leave his position. Michael J. Waller, the Lake County state's attorney, said: \"The comments attributed to Mike Mermel do not reflect my views on the role of the Lake County state's attorney's office. Nor do they reflect the manner in which my staff has conducted themselves over the last 21 years.\"", "headline": {"main": "Juan Rivera Goes Free", "kicker": "The 6th Floor"}, "_id": "4fd3a30f8eb7c8105d8ebe50", "word_count": 136, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-06T19:06:46Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
