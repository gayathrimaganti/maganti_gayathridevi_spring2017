In a newsletter sent to friends and colleagues and some journalists on Tuesday night about her current projects, Ms. Roth wrote that there should be news shortly on \"Leap of Faith\" and that \"hopefully\" it will open in the spring. The musical, which is expected to star four-time Tony Award nominee Ra\u00fal Esparza as an evangelical con man, has been rumored recently as the next tenant for the St. James Theater, given the possibility that its current musical, \"On A Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" will close soon. \"On A Clear Day,\" starring Harry Connick Jr., opened in December to mostly negative reviews and has been selling modestly at the box office.", "headline": {"main": "'Leap of Faith' Hopes to  Land  on Broadway This Spring", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2858eb7c8105d8ea9bc", "word_count": 472, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-11T13:52:56Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Roth, Daryl", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Esparza, Raul", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "St James Theater", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Leap of Faith (Play)", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
