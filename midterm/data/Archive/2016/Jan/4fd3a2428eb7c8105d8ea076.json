But if Santorum wins Iowa, \"we might as well sit back and declare Mitt Romney the nominee.\" (Judging by these quotes, the Romney camp seems to agree.)", "headline": {"main": "The Strengths of Rick Santorum", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2428eb7c8105d8ea076", "word_count": 713, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-03T12:01:08Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
