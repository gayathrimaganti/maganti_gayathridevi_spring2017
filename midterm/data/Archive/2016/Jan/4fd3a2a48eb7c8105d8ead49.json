Preliminary overnight Nielsen estimates suggest that the game -- won by the Giants, 31-14 -- was not only the highest-rated \"Sunday Night Football\" game since the program moved to NBC in 2006, but that it also had the best overnight rating of any Sunday prime-time N.F.L. broadcast in 13 years. It barely beat the ratings for this season's Week 1 game between the Cowboys and the New York Jets.", "headline": {"main": "Giants and Cowboys Lift NBC in Ratings", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2a48eb7c8105d8ead49", "word_count": 108, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-02T15:26:22Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "National Football League", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Television", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Football", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
