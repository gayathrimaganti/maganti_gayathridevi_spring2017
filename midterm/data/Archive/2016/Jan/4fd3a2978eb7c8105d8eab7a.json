If the standoff had lasted longer than a few days, and if blood had actually been spilled, we might now know it as the Parsley War. But on July 18, they were overwhelmed and forcibly ejected by Equipo 31, a crack team of Spanish special forces soldiers. No shots were fired.", "headline": {"main": "Fighting Over Parsley", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "_id": "4fd3a2978eb7c8105d8eab7a", "word_count": 1850, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-02T22:01:51Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Politics and Government", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Parsley", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Immigration and Emigration", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Gibraltar", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Morocco", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Spain", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
