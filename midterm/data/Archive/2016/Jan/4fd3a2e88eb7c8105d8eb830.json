I lease. I make developers pretty successful, but I'd rather own because when you leave, after 25 or 30 years, you don't own anything except the equipment, which ages like a car or your body.\"", "headline": {"main": "Do You Own the Building?", "kicker": "You're the Boss"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e88eb7c8105d8eb830", "word_count": 137, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-04T12:15:13Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Restaurants", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Real Estate (Commercial)", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Lynch, Barbara", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Small Business", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
