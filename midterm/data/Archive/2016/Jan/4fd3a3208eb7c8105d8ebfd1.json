This year, audiences can get ready to guard their laps against Cirque du Soleil acrobats who appear to be flying off the screen: Paramount said on Tuesday that it had acquired the distribution rights for a new 3-D movie about that Montreal-based circus troupe, written and directed by Andrew Adamson (of the \"Shrek\" and \"Narnia\" franchises) and produced by, among others, James Cameron (a filmmaker who knows a thing or two about 3-D movies). The film, called \"Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away,\" will feature performances from various shows presented by the troupe. Rob Moore, the vice chairman of Paramount, said in a statement that it will also include \"a timeless original story written especially for this movie.\" The studio said \"Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away\" is planned for worldwide release later this year.", "headline": {"main": "Cirque du Soleil 3-D Movie Coming at You This Year", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a3208eb7c8105d8ebfd1", "word_count": 173, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T11:28:33Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "unknown", "value": "Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away (Movie)", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Acrobats and Acrobatics", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Montreal (Quebec)", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Cameron, James", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Adamson, Andrew", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Circuses", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Movies", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Three-Dimensional Devices and Effects", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Cirque du Soleil", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Paramount Pictures", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
