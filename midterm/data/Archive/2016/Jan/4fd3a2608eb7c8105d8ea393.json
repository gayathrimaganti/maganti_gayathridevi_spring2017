They can only take flight from water, making such landings a death sentence for those that survived the impact.", "headline": {"main": "Other Voices: The Night it Snowed Grebes in Utah", "kicker": "Dot Earth"}, "_id": "4fd3a2608eb7c8105d8ea393", "word_count": 450, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T10:30:11Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Conservation of Resources", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Birds", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Biology and Biochemistry", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Utah", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
