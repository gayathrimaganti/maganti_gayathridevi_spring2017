One of my favorite blogs, \"It's Nice That,\" produces a collectable quarterly magazine of the same name with the mission of \"championing creativity.\" The editor, Alex Moshakis, describes it as a place for informal conversation about contemporary art, culture and design. Both the blog and the magazine feature expertly curated work from emerging and established artists. The magazine also includes a fiction section, interviews with artists and a revealing feature called \"On the bookshelves of...\" in which writers discuss the books that inspire them. The current issue focuses on the future of independent publishing and features interviews with i-D magazine's founder, Terry Jones, and the publisher of Nieves Books, Benjamin Sommerhalder; it also includes profiles on contributors to The Times Magazine Taryn Simon and Martin Parr. It's definitely worth checking out.", "headline": {"main": "'It's Nice That . . .
