Janet Pierson, producer of the festival's movie portion, noted \"a kind of aggressiveness, a boldness, risk-taking\" in 130 feature films that will screen between March 9 and March 17 in Austin, Tex. Ms. Pierson pointed, for example, to \"Dollhouse,\" an Irish film, from the writer-director Kirsten Sheridan, about five street kids who create havoc after breaking into a suburban Dublin home. Several documentaries in the program look at Los Angeles and the raucous past of its music culture. Those include \"Sunset Strip,\" about the history of that iconic portion of Sunset Boulevard, and \"Uprising: Hip Hop & the L.A. Riots.\" Celebrity figures in \"$ellebrity,\" a documentary by the star photographer Kevin Mazur, and in \"Decoding Deepak,\" also a documentary, in which Gotham Chopra examines his famous father, Deepak. The festival earlier announced that it would host the premiere of \"The Cabin in the Woods,\" a long-awaited horror film directed by Drew Goddard and written by Mr. Goddard and Joss Whedon. In all, programmers reviewed 1,957 feature-length submissions, including 1,387 from the United States, and 570 from abroad, the festival said.
