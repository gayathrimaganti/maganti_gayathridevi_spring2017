Three months later, \"Mylo Xyloto\" has finally come to Spotify, Rhapsody, MOG and others. The Black Keys, however, another prominent holdout, has not made its latest album, \"El Camino,\" available for streaming.", "headline": {"main": "Digital Notes: Coldplay Finally Streams and Saving Megaupload Files", "kicker": "Media Decoder"}, "_id": "4fd3a33b8eb7c8105d8ec30b", "word_count": 251, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T17:37:24Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Decisions and Verdicts", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Spotify", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Bail", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Dotcom, Kim", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Music", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Black Keys", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Coldplay", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Megaupload", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Rhapsody.com", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
