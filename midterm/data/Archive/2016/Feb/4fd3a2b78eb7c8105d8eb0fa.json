Based on preliminary Nielsen ratings, the top choice was once again \"The Big Bang Theory\" on CBS as it finished with a higher rating than \"American Idol\" in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic for the third week in a row. \u00a0The good news for Fox was that \"Idol\" at least momentarily put a stop to its recent ratings slide, down only slightly among adults 18-to-49, and even gained back total viewers when compared to last week with an average of 17.1 million. It was still down 28 percent in the 18-to-49 category from the same Thursday episode last year.", "headline": {"main": "'Big Bang' on CBS Holds On Despite Fox's 'Idol' Comeback", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2b78eb7c8105d8eb0fa", "word_count": 151, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-03T16:00:37Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
