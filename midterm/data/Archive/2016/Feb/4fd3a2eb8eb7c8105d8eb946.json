Yet a committee of artists and scholars did just that, in order to remedy the critical lack of knowledge about Latin American photography. The outcome of this extensive research is FOTO/GR\u00c1FICA, an exhibition at\u00a0Le Bal in Paris (through April 8 at 6 Impasse de la D\u00e9fense; 33-1-44-70-75-56).The exhibition surveys a century of Latin American history through photography books, spotlighting forgotten works as well as those that never made it beyond limited circles. The director of Le Bal, Diane Dufour, described the complex task of unearthing the books without systematic cultural records: each was as much a material get as a historical discovery.\u00a0The findings were then narrowed down according to various criteria, including image quality, printing quality, layout.", "headline": {"main": "A Century of Latin American Photography, in Paris", "kicker": "In Transit"}, "_id": "4fd3a2eb8eb7c8105d8eb946", "word_count": 236, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-06T06:00:15Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Travel and Vacations", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Photography", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Art", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Latin America", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Paris (France)", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
