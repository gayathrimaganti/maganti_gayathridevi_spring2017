One of the works, set to the music of Philip Glass, is to have its first performance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center this summer. The second will have its premiere in the fall, during the company's regular season, at Lincoln Center. The work will be an expanded version of \"Tales of a Chinese Zodiac,\" which Mr. Peck, 24, first presented in 2010 at the New York Choreographic Institute.
