They will not affect any of the Icelandic singer/multimedia pop star's other planned shows, according to a statement from a publicist. She performed material from her \"Biophilia\" album last Friday (Ben Ratliff's review of that show is here), and again on Monday. She is scheduled to perform next on Sunday, and also has shows next week on Feb. 15 and 18. Refunds for those who bought tickets to Thursday's show will be available where the tickets were purchased.", "headline": {"main": "Bj\u00f6rk Cancels Thursday Concert", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a33c8eb7c8105d8ec3f1", "word_count": 97, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T14:29:53Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Queens (NYC)", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "New York Hall of Science", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bjork", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
