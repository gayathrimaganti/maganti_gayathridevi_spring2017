Every season, however, the designer anchors her collection with a motif that's whimsical, graphic, even a tad goofy. Over the years we've seen Art Deco swimmers (spring 2005), digital renderings of feathers (fall '11) and, recently, Herrera's own toy poodle, Gaspar (prefall '12). \"It's very important to have at least one print in every collection,\" says the designer, who draws inspirations from many places. For instance, for the print of red deck chairs in resort '08, she studied the paintings of the interiors illustrator Jeremiah Goodman. A Paul Poiret silk scarf begat the na\u00efve garden radishes in spring '06. \"Print adds a touch of fantasy and is the perfect link for bringing all of the components of the collection together,\" she says. Plus, they're fun to look at and wear - as Herrera herself explains, \"Fashion is for the eyes.\" This season we're aflutter over her Bauhaus birds in lemon and scarlet.", "headline": {"main": "Print Run | Carolina Herrera", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2b68eb7c8105d8eb096", "word_count": 176, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T09:00:10Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Herrera, Carolina", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
