Long is about as far from the world of Broadway as possible. Yet this self-employed, self-taught, self-described \"artist in wood\" was chosen by the Broadway advertising agency Serino Coyne to help design a poster image for the coming Broadway production of \"Peter and the Starcatcher.\" Developed by Disney Theatrical Productions from Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson's popular children's novel of 2004, \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" is an origin story based on the character made popular in J. M. Barrie's original \"Peter Pan.\" The show transfers to Broadway next month after a well-reviewed run at New York Theater Workshop last year.", "headline": {"main": "Behind the Poster: 'Peter and the Starcatcher'", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e38eb7c8105d8eb6ce", "word_count": 832, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T13:19:48Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Posters", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Art", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Wood and Wood Products", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
