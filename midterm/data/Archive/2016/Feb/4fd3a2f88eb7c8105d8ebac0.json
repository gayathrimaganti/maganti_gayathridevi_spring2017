The difference, though, is that Santorum is a stronger anti-Romney candidate than the combustible and compromised Gingrich, with wider geographic appeal (as he demonstrated last night) and fewer glaring liabilities. So whereas Romney was able to dispose of Gingrich pretty easily during the brief window where the race seemed to be down to a two-man race between them, if he gets into a two-man race with Santorum he's probably facing a much longer and more grueling contest.", "headline": {"main": "Romney's Long Slog", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2f88eb7c8105d8ebac0", "word_count": 290, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-08T09:25:56Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
