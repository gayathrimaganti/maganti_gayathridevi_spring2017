And Billboard reports that \"Gimme All Your Luvin',\" the first single, racked up 2,766 spins on Top 40 stations from its premiere on Friday morning through Sunday night. That was largely due to the support of 95 Clear Channel Communications stations, which played the song every hour, on the hour, and accounted for 79 percent of the song's plays on that format.", "headline": {"main": "Digital Notes: Madonna's Super Bowl Bounce", "kicker": "Media Decoder"}, "_id": "4fd3a32d8eb7c8105d8ec01c", "word_count": 284, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-06T14:48:31Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Music", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Copyrights and Copyright Violations", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Madonna", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Super Bowl", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Clear Channel Communications Inc", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "iTunes", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Vice (Magazine)", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YouTube.com", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
