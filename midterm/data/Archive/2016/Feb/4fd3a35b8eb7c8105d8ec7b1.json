The yearly gathering of as many Oscar nominees as will attend (this year 150 showed up) was scheduled to last between noon and 2 p.m. in the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel. But it was 2:08 by the time Ric Robertson, the chief operating officer of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, got around to introducing Brian Grazer and Don Mischer, who will be producing the Feb. 26 Oscar ceremony.", "headline": {"main": "A Harbinger of a Longish Awards Show", "kicker": "Carpetbagger"}, "_id": "4fd3a35b8eb7c8105d8ec7b1", "word_count": 467, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-06T18:28:13Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Pitt, Brad", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Hanks, Tom", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Grazer, Brian", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Sherak, Tom", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Streep, Meryl", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "von Sydow, Max", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
