Rather, the exam is a passageway to the last few years of high school.\u00a0 The rulebook also states that a British student must then enter college within two years of \"completing high school.\"\u00a0 Because Temi repeated her junior year after she got to America, she was ruled ineligible to play her freshman year in college.)", "headline": {"main": "Stupid N.C.A.A.
