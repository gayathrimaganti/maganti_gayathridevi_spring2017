About half a million people voted early, a record for a primary in the state, and turnout on Tuesday was unusually high as well. The amendment, which passed by a margin of more than 20 percentage points, was on the ballot along with other party primary races, some of which were closely contested.", "headline": {"main": "Ban on Gay Marriage Passes in North Carolina"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b81", "word_count": 568, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/us/09carolina1/09carolina1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/us/09carolina1/09carolina1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 372, "url": "images/2012/05/09/us/CAROLINA/CAROLINA-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/us/CAROLINA/CAROLINA-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 372, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NORTH CAROLINA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, CIVIL UNIONS AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
