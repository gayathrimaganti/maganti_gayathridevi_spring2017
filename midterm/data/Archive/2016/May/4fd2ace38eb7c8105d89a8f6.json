The soft-shell crab remains an exception. Starting in May and throughout the summer, the blue crab abandons its shell and starts to form a new one, making its sweet, briny, delicious meat -- usually incredibly tough to get at -- immediately accessible. When the crab is molting, in fact, practically the whole thing is edible, and the new shell is among the best parts. The combination of tenderness and crunch makes it one of the great delights of eating. (If you're squeamish about this, I suggest you get over it, or swear off animal products altogether.) The shell remains soft for only a few hours after the crab has molted, making timing just about everything for this industry, located mostly on the central Atlantic coast and most famously in Chesapeake Bay. But the crabs ship well and are available nationwide right now. Most soft-shell crabs you see at the market are ready to cook. This may not be the case if you're buying them from a real fishmonger, in which case you should ask to have them cleaned. At that point, I'd cook them within 24 hours; if you want to keep them longer than that, buy them live and clean them yourself.", "headline": {"main": "The Soft-Shell Hard Sell", "kicker": "EAT"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a8f6", "word_count": 1283, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06eat1/06eat1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06eat1/06eat1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 499, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06eat1/06eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06eat1/06eat1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 499, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SAUCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CRABS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
