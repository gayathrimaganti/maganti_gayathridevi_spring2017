The Dessners, twin musicians who are part of the indie band the National, also realized that this was an impossible undertaking. ''We're looking at this community of musicians that have decided to call Brooklyn their home, which is a pretty wide range,'' Bryce said. ''There's so much different music happening. We tried to involve things we liked, and it's still just a fraction of what's out there.'' The festival is not a full retrospective, he added, but ''a snapshot of certain corners of Brooklyn.''", "headline": {"main": "Brooklyn's Musical Matrix"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d894fdb", "word_count": 466, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/CROSSING-REFER/CROSSING-REFER-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/arts/CROSSING-REFER/CROSSING-REFER-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/CROSSING-REFER/CROSSING-REFER-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/arts/CROSSING-REFER/CROSSING-REFER-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "DESSNER, AARON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DESSNER, BRYCE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "BROOKLYN (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
