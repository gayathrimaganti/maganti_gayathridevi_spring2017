John W. Hickenlooper could revive a bill that would have allowed civil unions for same-sex couples in Colorado. The bill died late Tuesday night after lawmakers reached an impasse over whether it would be heard on the floor of the House of Representatives before the legislative session concluded on Wednesday. The apparent end to the civil unions bill that night was a blow to its supporters, who appeared to have mustered enough votes, including those of several Republicans, to pass it. The bill, which had already passed the State Senate, needed to be heard on the House floor before midnight. Mr. Hickenlooper, a Democrat, had said he intended to sign it.", "headline": {"main": "Call for Legislature to Revive Colorado's Civil Union Bill"}, "_id": "4fd2bbab8eb7c8105d8b1be4", "word_count": 441, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-09T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HICKENLOOPER, JOHN W"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "COLORADO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATE LEGISLATURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, CIVIL UNIONS AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
