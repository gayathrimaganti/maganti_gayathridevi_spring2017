There was the time when the performance artist Marina Abramovic sat stock-still for 700 hours, staring at the hundreds of worshipful visitors who came to gaze into her soul. And the time when the artist pair Allora & Calzadilla presented ''Stop, Repair, Prepare: Variations on 'Ode to Joy' for a Prepared Piano.'' The two cut a hole in the case of Bechstein baby grand and set it on casters, then hired musicians to play Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy'' from inside the hole while maneuvering the piano slowly through the space. There was also the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson's rotating metal fan, which swung from a cable just above head height. Next will be a garage sale. MoMA curators and officials have already started clearing out their closets and attics to recreate ''Meta-Monumental Garage Sale'' by the Brooklyn artist Martha Rosler.", "headline": {"main": "Hey, Want to Buy My White Elephant?", "kicker": "INSIDE ART"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1722", "word_count": 1038, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04VOGEL_SPAN/04VOGEL_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04VOGEL_SPAN/04VOGEL_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04VOGEL_SPAN/04VOGEL_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04VOGEL_SPAN/04VOGEL_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KILIMNIK, KAREN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SMITH, KIKI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ATAMAN, KUTLUG"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROSLER, MARTHA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
