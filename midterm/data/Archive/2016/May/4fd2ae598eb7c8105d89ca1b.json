The bill matters, not just to Canada but to the world: The boreal forests and tundra of northern Canada remain a relatively intact ecosystem, absorbing more carbon than the world's tropical forests and providing a vital buffer against global warming. Industrial development would weaken that buffer, and, as things stand now, there is almost nothing to prevent it. As envisioned by Mr. Charest, the bill would have made a firm commitment to prevent all industrial activity. As revised by government bureaucrats, the latest version promises only that, at some future point, steps will be taken to ''protect the environment, maintain biodiversity, enhance the natural heritage and promote the sustainable use of resources.'' Mr. Charest is the leader of a majority government, so the bill will almost certainly pass. Before it does, it needs to be strengthened to prohibit even piecemeal development in this sensitive region.", "headline": {"main": "Quebec's Front-Line Forests", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca1b", "word_count": 277, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CHAREST, JEAN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "QUEBEC PROVINCE (CANADA)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FORESTS AND FORESTRY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENVIRONMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial"}
