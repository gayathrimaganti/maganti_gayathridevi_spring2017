These cheeses tend to be funkier and stinkier than other types, and are often high on the lists of connoisseurs. Now, Whole Foods markets in the Northeast have come up with one of their own. The raw cow's milk cheese, in plump four-inch disks made by Sprout Creek Farm in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is washed with Sixpoint Brownstone Brown Ale, from Red Hook, Brooklyn. It was developed by Chris Manca, the specialty products coordinator for the markets' Northeast division, who named it Point of Origin. Its grassy aroma, with a whiff of malt, does not announce its presence boldly. The sticky rind is beige and deepens in color as it ages; the satiny ivory cheese within is mellow, with a sweetly tangy bite. Not ready for \u00c9poisses? This is the cheese for you.", "headline": {"main": "Cheese With a Brooklyn Point of View", "kicker": "FOOD STUFF"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914f1", "word_count": 236, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09STUFF_CHEESE/09STUFF_CHEESE-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09STUFF_CHEESE/09STUFF_CHEESE-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "WHOLE FOODS MARKET INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHEESE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
