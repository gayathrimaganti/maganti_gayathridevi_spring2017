For starters, when did cancer become funny? Not that it's ever hilarious, even in laugh-lined movies like ''Funny People'' and ''50/50,'' to name two comedy-drama amalgams that combine cancer and chuckles in one improbable package. Certainly it isn't funny in ''A Little Bit of Heaven,'' a cringe-inducing romantic comedy turned cancer tragedy turned inspirational hosanna about living in the moment, embracing your bliss and other clich\u00e9s. Kate Hudson stars as Marley Corbett, an advertising whiz and self-described slut who lives in New Orleans, where the sun doesn't just shine but also bathes her in radiant, honeyed light. Life is just one long and lovely feminine hygiene commercial: She has a cool apartment in the French Quarter; a slobbering dog named Stanley; and the modern miss's equivalent of the faithful companion, a gay black friend, Peter (Romany Malco), a Chingachgook for the age of Bravo TV. On backup there's the married mom friend, Renee (Rosemarie DeWitt), and a kooky singleton, Sarah (Lucy Punch). Marley also has a hookup book that she regularly dips into for recreational sex. As she explains in the voice-over: ''The whole matrimonial, maternal fairy tale'' isn't for her.", "headline": {"main": "Dancing on Her Own Grave With a Spring in Her Step", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c626", "word_count": 632, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LITTLE_SPAN/04LITTLE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LITTLE_SPAN/04LITTLE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LITTLE_SPAN/04LITTLE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LITTLE_SPAN/04LITTLE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN, A (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KASSELL, NICOLE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HUDSON, KATE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
