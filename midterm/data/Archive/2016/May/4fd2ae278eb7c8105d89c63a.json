''The 39 Steps'' was originally a big, serious, classic 1935 Alfred Hitchcock movie about spies between the wars, dashing heroes and classy dames. There was gorgeous black-and-white Scottish and English scenery, and that tingling, suspenseful finale at the London Palladium (nice set by Yoshi Tanokura).", "headline": {"main": "Revisiting A Thriller, Revised As a Farce", "kicker": "ARTS | NEW JERSEY"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c63a", "word_count": 727, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN/06ARTSNJ1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE 39 STEPS (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BARLOW, PATRICK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SHANAHAN, MARK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HITCHCOCK, ALFRED"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MCGILLIN, HOWARD"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW JERSEY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "GEORGE STREET PLAYHOUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
