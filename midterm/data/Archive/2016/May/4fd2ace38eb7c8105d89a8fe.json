Johnson, now up to its fourth volume, ''The Passage of Power,'' which was published this month. Mr. Caro lives on Central Park West with his wife, Ina, whose most recent book is ''Paris to the Past: Traveling Through French History by Train.'' He typically spends Sunday working. MOMENTUM Most Sundays, with the exception of football Sundays, I work, because I don't take days off as long as I'm working on something that's supposed to be all in the same mood. That could be a chapter or four chapters. Then we take a long vacation. I don't work all that hard. If I've finished a chapter or section and I'm taking a day off and it's a Sunday, we start by going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "headline": {"main": "Rising Early, a New Sentence in Mind", "kicker": "SUNDAY ROUTINE | ROBERT A.
