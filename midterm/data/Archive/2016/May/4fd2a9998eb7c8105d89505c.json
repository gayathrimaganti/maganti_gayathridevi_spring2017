Halsey Junior High School 157 in Queens have a tough assignment before them: design a new playground that will transform a sea of black asphalt at their school into a recreational oasis -- and, while they are at it, help clean up New York City's waterways. So, in addition to benches, play equipment, ball courts and drinking fountains, their wish list includes a butterfly garden and a gravel-lined turf field. Those features will capture precipitation and prevent it from overloading the city's sewer system, which, in the case of their Rego Park neighborhood, spews raw sewage into Flushing Bay when it rains.", "headline": {"main": "Getting Lessons on Water By Designing a Playground"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d89505c", "word_count": 869, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/SEWER/SEWER-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/SEWER/SEWER-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 397, "url": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/SEWER/SEWER-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/nyregion/SEWER/SEWER-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 397, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "QUEENS (NYC)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEWERS AND SEWAGE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION (K-12)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WATER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PARKS AND OTHER RECREATION AREAS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLAYGROUNDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WASTE MATERIALS AND DISPOSAL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
