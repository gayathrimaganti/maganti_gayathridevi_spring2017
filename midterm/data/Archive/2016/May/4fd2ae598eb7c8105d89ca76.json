Block-letter words pop up on the screen: ''humanity,'' ''struggle,'' ''socialism.'' It looks for all the world like a ''Daily Show'' parody. And then comes a close-up of the show's host and star, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, president of Venezuela, usually dressed in all red or a military jacket, sometimes crowned with a Che-style beret, standing on the road among his supporters or before a live audience at Miraflores Palace in Caracas. The show is entirely unscripted. Ch\u00e1vez usually begins by stating the date and saying, ''Al\u00f3 Presidente!'' then grinning and giving himself a round of applause. ''Al\u00f3 Presidente!'' he repeats and you can't tell if he's introducing the program by its title or simply greeting and congratulating himself. ''Al\u00f3 Presidente'' (''Hello President'') is broadcast live in Venezuela on Sundays from 11 a.m. until Ch\u00e1vez is done talking, which can take anywhere from four to eight hours. It is the only television show in the world in which a head of state regularly invites cameras to follow him as he governs. (Two other South American presidents, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador, briefly spun off their own shows after appearing as guests on ''Al\u00f3 Presidente'' and being interviewed Oprah-style by Ch\u00e1vez.) But with the exception of the logorrheic Fidel Castro, it's hard to imagine another political figure with the combination of manic exhibitionism and entertainer's stamina required to star in this sort of show, never mind the autocratic control required to make it, literally, must-see TV in his home country.", "headline": {"main": "Must-Watch Television.
