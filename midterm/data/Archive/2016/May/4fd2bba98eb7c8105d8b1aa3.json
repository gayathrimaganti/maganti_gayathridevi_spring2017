Gen. Mark S. Martins both to prove them guilty and to show the world that the tribunal system is now legitimate. ''We're going to have a fair trial,'' General Martins, the chief prosecutor in the military commissions system, said in an interview this week. ''There are a lot of people who come to this with preconceptions about unfairness, and I would just ask people to withhold judgment. The initial version of commissions was flawed, but there has been a lot of work on reforms.''", "headline": {"main": "At Guant\u00e1namo, Trial for 9/11 Defendants, and for a Revamped Tribunal"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1aa3", "word_count": 1319, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MARTINS, MARK S"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MOHAMMED, KHALID SHAIKH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HAWSAWI, MUSTAFA AHMED AL-"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE (CUBA)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DETAINEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEPTEMBER 11 (2001)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MILITARY TRIBUNALS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
