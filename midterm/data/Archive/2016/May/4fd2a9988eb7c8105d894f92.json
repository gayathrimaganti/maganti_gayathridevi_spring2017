Stupid, yes, and even tragic, but it was considered a ''bait stealer,'' and got in the way of catching the more challenging and beloved striper. Then we discovered that skate was good to eat -- at least as good as striper -- and within a span of just a few years, skate became scarce. Not only is it no longer littering Atlantic beaches, but it is also no longer stealing bait. In fact, it is no longer around much, and stores like Whole Foods are pledging not to carry the fish until the stocks recover.", "headline": {"main": "With Skate a No-Show, Halibut Does a Star Turn", "kicker": "HOW TO COOK EVERYTHING"}, "_id": "4fd2a9988eb7c8105d894f92", "word_count": 762, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/dining/02BITTMAN_SPAN/02BITTMAN_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/dining/02BITTMAN_SPAN/02BITTMAN_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEAFOOD"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
