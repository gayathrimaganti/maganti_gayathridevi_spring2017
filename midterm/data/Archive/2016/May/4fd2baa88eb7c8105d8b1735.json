The West Wing, as on most Sunday evenings, is quiet except for the tight circle of advisers who gather for a confidential briefing on his re-election. The gathering often takes place after Mr. Obama's regular Sunday round of golf, and while the atmosphere is casual, the agenda is anything but: keeping the president immersed in what it will take to win a second term. He receives an update on how his operation is expanding in battleground states, he watches previews of television ads and he studies a presentation on his various paths to victory.", "headline": {"main": "At Sunday Meetings, Team Obama Prepares For a Grueling Fight"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1735", "word_count": 1296, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/us/05campaign-1/05campaign-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/us/05campaign-1/05campaign-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/05/us/05campaign-1/05campaign-1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/05/us/05campaign-1/05campaign-1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S. / Politics", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
