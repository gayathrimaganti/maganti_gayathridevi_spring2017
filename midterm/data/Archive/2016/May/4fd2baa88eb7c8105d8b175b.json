By 1938, the couple were selling the 5-cent pans for a quarter a piece. Morrison used the proceeds to buy Nay a $35 diamond engagement ring. After a stint as an Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, Morrison tried his hand at developing ''a flying disk far superior to that of a flying cake pan.'' Together with a butane supplier named Warren Franscioni, they created the Flyin-Saucer, but it didn't go very far until Morrison created a new version in 1955, dubbed the Pluto Platter. The disc had a bump that evoked an alien cockpit on top and the names of the planets around its rim. Wham-O, the visionary toy company known for its slingshots and, soon, its Hula-Hoops, bought the rights in 1957. Wham-O renamed the flying disc Frisbee, which Morrison didn't like one bit. ''Had I been consulted, I'd have vehemently objected,'' he wrote in his account of the Frisbee business (written with Phil Kennedy),''Flat Flip Flies Straight!'' Wham-O went on to nix the alien cockpit and planetary names, opting instead for a new, sportier disc with a stripe in the center and the words ''Official Pro Model'' on top. By the mid-1960s, ''there was one of everybody's roof,'' says Robert Rauch, president of the World Flying Disc Federation. The Frisbee was, quite simply, ''cool,'' says Tim Walsh, author of a book on Wham-O. ''This thing rose on the wind.'' DISC DRIVE", "headline": {"main": "Who Made That?
