Mr. Yauch, along with Michael Diamond and Adam Horovitz, wrote raps in an apartment at 59 Chrystie Street. ''Polly Wog Stew,'' an early release, was recorded in a basement on Avenue A. And the cover of the Beastie Boys' 1989 album, ''Paul's Boutique,'' featured a ragtag clothing store at Ludlow and Rivington Streets.", "headline": {"main": "New York Neighborhoods Pay Tribute to a Beastie Boy"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca68", "word_count": 765, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/us/OBIT-YAUCH/OBIT-YAUCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/us/OBIT-YAUCH/OBIT-YAUCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "YAUCH, ADAM"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "EAST VILLAGE (NYC)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "LOWER EAST SIDE (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LIVING ROOM, THE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BEASTIE BOYS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BARS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RAP AND HIP-HOP"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Biography"}
