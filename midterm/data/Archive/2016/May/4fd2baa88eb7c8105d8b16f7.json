Kipsang had established a virtually unassailable lead, so his win was anticlimactic. For Kenyans in this remote town, widely acclaimed for the marathon talent it produces, a mere victory is insufficient. More than two minutes after Kipsang won, in 2 hours 4 minutes 44 seconds, his compatriot Martin Lel edged Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia in a full sprint to secure second place. That sent the crowd into jubilation.", "headline": {"main": "Paths to Marathon In Small Kenyan Town"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b16f7", "word_count": 1109, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/sports/YITEN1/YITEN1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/sports/YITEN1/YITEN1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/02/sports/YITEN1/YITEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/sports/YITEN1/YITEN1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KEITANY, MARY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KIPSANG, WILSON"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "KENYA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ITEN (KENYA)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RUNNING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MARATHON RUNNING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
