The book was Hilary Mantel's ''Wolf Hall,'' and it would have dwarfed the competition any year. ''Wolf Hall'' was a historical novel that ingeniously revisited well-trod territory (the early marriages of Henry VIII), turned the phlegmatic villain Thomas Cromwell into the best-drawn figure and easily mixed 16th-century ambience with timeless bitchery. Despite a hugely complicated cast of characters and Ms. Mantel's teasing way of preferring pronouns to proper names, it wound up providing an experience of sheer bliss. It was a hard act to follow. But the follow-up is equally sublime.", "headline": {"main": "A Canny Henchman, Targeting The Queen", "kicker": "BOOKS OF THE TIMES"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d8913ff", "word_count": 1224, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/arts/02book3/02book3-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/arts/02book3/02book3-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Books", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BRING UP THE BODIES (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MANTEL, HILARY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
