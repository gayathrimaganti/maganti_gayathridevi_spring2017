When I was in high school my mother decided I should learn to dance, so she bought me ballroom dance lessons as a graduation gift. She believed people should be comfortable walking onto a dance floor with a partner. For a while, I was obsessive about dancing. One summer I painted a dance studio in exchange for more lessons. I was also obsessed with chemistry and physics in high school. In 1994, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in biological sciences. My senior year, I got a job at the alumni relations office calling alumni for donations. I called one man with whom I had a lot in common, a doctor from Manhattan who had been a biology major. We met and I ended up working for him at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center on a research project after I graduated.", "headline": {"main": "Dance Lessons in Life", "kicker": "THE BOSS"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a8ea", "word_count": 645, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/business/6-BOSS/6-BOSS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/business/6-BOSS/6-BOSS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Job Market", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OLSEN, PATRICIA R"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MEDIDATA SOLUTIONS WORLDWIDE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EXECUTIVES AND MANAGEMENT (THEORY)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
