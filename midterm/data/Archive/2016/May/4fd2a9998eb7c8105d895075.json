The European Union was more direct, asking Iran to suspend the enrichment, a step that Iran has said it will never take. The American and European statements, made at an international nonproliferation conference in Vienna, may have reflected diplomatic posturing two weeks before the next planned round of negotiations with Iran on the uranium enrichment dispute, to be convened in Baghdad. But the statements also seemed to suggest that the atmosphere of good will in seeking to resolve the dispute diplomatically may have begun to fade.", "headline": {"main": "U.S. and Europe Press Iran Before Next Nuclear Talks"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895075", "word_count": 696, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Middle East", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "IRAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EUROPEAN UNION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NUCLEAR WEAPONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
