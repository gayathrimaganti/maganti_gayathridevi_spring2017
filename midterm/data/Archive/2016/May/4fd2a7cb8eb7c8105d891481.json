''I know I, I won't make it/don't know what to do,'' Asa Taccone sang over the tootling major chords and snappy, handclapping beat of ''Waves'' from the group's debut album, ''Mondo'' (Downtown/Across the Universe). On the album, Electric Guest is the project of Mr. Taccone, its singer and keyboardist; Matthew Compton, its guitarist, bassist and drummer; and their producing and songwriting collaborator in the studio, Brian Burton (a k a Danger Mouse). Only future Electric Guest releases will reveal how much or how little Mr. Burton shaped this album. The music shares quite a bit with other Danger Mouse projects like Broken Bells and Gnarls Barkley: analog-sounding keyboards, quasi-vintage bass and guitar tones, and a fondness for the way 1960s rock and soul were distilled by new wave rock.", "headline": {"main": "Revising Retro While Pondering Choices", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d891481", "word_count": 408, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/ELECTRIC/ELECTRIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/arts/ELECTRIC/ELECTRIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 355, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/ELECTRIC/ELECTRIC-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/05/arts/ELECTRIC/ELECTRIC-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 355, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BOWERY BALLROOM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ELECTRIC GUEST"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
