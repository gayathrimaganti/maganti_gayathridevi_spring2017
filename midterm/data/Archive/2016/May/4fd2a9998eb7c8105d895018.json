He doesn't fit easily into one. In the 1950s he played plush, sliding, unconstricted, just-on-the-edge-of-shouting trombone lines among some musicians who were otherwise concerned with getting their sound tighter and spikier. (I'm trying not to say that he confounded the perceived line between swing and bebop, but there, I said it.) His own records on Blue Note, particularly ''Soul Stirrin,' '' are beautiful, but a newly released recording of him with the young Hank Mobley's band at the Piccadilly Club in Newark, ''Hank Mobley: Newark 1953'' (Uptown Records), can help you toward a better understanding of the daily reality of jazz. It's a couple of sets on a loose and boozy Monday night. Green's the special guest with Mobley's house band, including the pianist Walter Davis Jr., the bassist Jimmy Schenck and the drummer Charli Persip, and they're playing Green's repertory: ''Embraceable You,'' a bunch of ballads, Green's own ''Blues Is Green.'' (Green was invited by the comedian Redd Foxx, who booked jazz at the club one night a week.) Perhaps there are no eras, only individuals. Green was seven years older than the Newark-based Mobley, which meant that Mobley came to musical consciousness idolizing Charlie Parker, whereas Green did not. (Green had played alongside Parker in Earl Hines's big band in 1943, before Parker had much of a reputation.) Mobley's more than fine here, modern and bluesy and effortful, but Green is on a different plane, serene, joyous. He's riding on the swing, riffing, repeating notes. You could listen to him all day, and there's two hours' worth here.", "headline": {"main": "From Jazz Heirlooms to Doom Metal", "kicker": "PLAYLIST"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895018", "word_count": 810, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN/06PLAYLIST1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GREEN, BENNIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LEVERT, EDDIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CUNNINGHAM, DARREN J"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "OKAZAKI, MILES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "UFOMAMMUT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
