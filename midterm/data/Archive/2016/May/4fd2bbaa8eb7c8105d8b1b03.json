But a touch of green is within everyone's reach. Low-maintenance terrariums or indoor cactus gardens make cheerful, lasting gifts. And cooks who enjoy fresh ingredients can grow herbs or harvest a crop of mushrooms just an arm's length away in their own kitchen. For newlyweds who do have a yard, there is a sequoia sapling that will grow (one to three feet a year!) with the marriage, as well as new chairs to decorate a patio or terrace. For couples who prefer to sit indoors by their coffee table, a new book of photography by the New York landscape artist Paula Hayes will be available later this month.", "headline": {"main": "If the Ring Finger Isn't a Green Thumb", "kicker": "THE REGISTRY"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b03", "word_count": 484, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/fashion/06REGISTRY_SPAN/06REGISTRY_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/fashion/06REGISTRY_SPAN/06REGISTRY_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/06/fashion/06REGISTRY_SPAN/06REGISTRY_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/fashion/06REGISTRY_SPAN/06REGISTRY_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Fashion & Style / Weddings/Celebrations", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ANTHROPOLOGIE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HAMMACHER SCHLEMMER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WILLIAMS-SONOMA INC"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "RESTORATION HARDWARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WEDDINGS AND ENGAGEMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FLOWERS AND PLANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INTERIOR DESIGN AND FURNISHINGS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GARDENS AND GARDENING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
