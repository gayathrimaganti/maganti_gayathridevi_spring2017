These visionaries have repurposed all manner of neglected buildings, turning river piers, churches, warehouses and factories into handsome dining spots. In Westchester County, one of the most recent and brilliant of these renovations is Club Car, carved into the handsome 19th-century Mamaroneck train station. The careful renewal of this jewel is the work of Brian MacMenamin, the executive chef, and the resulting restaurant is a beauty. The dark polished wainscoting and unobtrusive attention from well-trained gray-vested servers give Club Car the feel of a men's club. But its masculinity is countered by soft lighting, patches of original stained glass, many gleaming crystal chandeliers, bronze-colored ceiling tiles, long windows and a towering silken spray of branches in seasonal bloom. There is a retro-European-yet-modern aura to the place, complex harmonies that the short, eclectic menu picks up, with a few dishes so old-fashioned that they seem brand new. Even the steakhouse offerings have range and flair, as do the raw bar, the echoes of haute cuisine and, especially, the appetizers that venture into other ethnicities.", "headline": {"main": "Classic Dishes On an Eclectic Menu", "kicker": "WESTCHESTER DINING | MAMARONECK"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c65f", "word_count": 866, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINEWE3/06DINEWE3-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINEWE3/06DINEWE3-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINEWE1_SPAN/06DINEWE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINEWE1_SPAN/06DINEWE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "WESTCHESTER COUNTY (NY)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "MAMARONECK (NY)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CLUB CAR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
