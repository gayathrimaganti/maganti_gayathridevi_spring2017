My preference is for her plush-evening-length dances -- the transcendent ''Time is the echo of an ax within a wood'' or her African dance-tinged ballet, ''Itutu.'' Alas, her latest evening, ''Werk!: The Armitage Gone Variety Show'' is of the bits-and-pieces persuasion.", "headline": {"main": "Dancing With a Yawning Weimaraner", "kicker": "DANCE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1723", "word_count": 543, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ARMITAGE_SPAN/04ARMITAGE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ARMITAGE_SPAN/04ARMITAGE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ARMITAGE_SPAN/04ARMITAGE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ARMITAGE_SPAN/04ARMITAGE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ARMITAGE, KAROLE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ARMITAGE GONE] DANCE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ARMITAGE GONE!
