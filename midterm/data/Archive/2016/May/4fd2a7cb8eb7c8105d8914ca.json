''The Avengers'' have crushed you. In a strong start to Hollywood's summer movie season the superhero team in ''Marvel's The Avengers'' took in about $200.3 million at North American theaters over the weekend, according to Walt Disney Studios, which released the film. That No. 1 result easily smashed what the movie industry considers the record, set last summer by ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,'' for the biggest opening weekend of all time. Its total was $169.2 million if you don't account for inflation, or about $172 million if you do.", "headline": {"main": "'Avengers' Vanquish Box-Office Rivals"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914ca", "word_count": 991, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BOX/07BOX-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BOX/07BOX-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BOX/07BOX-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BOX/07BOX-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 2 (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "AVENGERS, THE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WHEDON, JOSS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WALT DISNEY COMPANY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
