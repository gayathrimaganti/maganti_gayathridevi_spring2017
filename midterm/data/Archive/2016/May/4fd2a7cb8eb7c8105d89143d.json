As the malevolent matriarch in ''Mother's Day'' -- an unnecessary remake of an unremarkable 1980 shocker -- she soothes and sneers with commendable conviction. Unfortunately her cinematic offspring never come close to keeping up. A home-invasion thriller for housing-bubble victims, this latest chunk of throwaway sadism from Darren Lynn Bousman (who directed ''Saw II'' through ''Saw IV'') sends three adult brothers racing home after bungling a bank robbery, only to find their property foreclosed and their mama gone. Meanwhile, the home's new owners (Frank Grillo and Jaime King) and assorted yuppie friends are enjoying a birthday party in the basement. Let's count the ways we can torture them before Mother arrives!", "headline": {"main": "Mother's Day", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d89143d", "word_count": 277, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 341, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN/04RDP_MOTHERS_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 341, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "MOTHER'S DAY (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DE MORNAY, REBECCA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BOUSMAN, DARREN LYNN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
