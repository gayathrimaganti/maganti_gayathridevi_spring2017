W. G. Sebald, the German-born author of ''The Emigrants,''''Austerlitz'' and ''The Rings of Saturn,'' who died in a car accident in 2001 at 57, had a sensibility sufficiently distinctive to warrant such immortality. The only problem -- or, rather, the characteristic paradox -- is that ''Sebaldian'' would have to mean something like ''systematically resistant to classification.'' Was he a novelist? A memoirist? A historian? A travel writer? When one of his publishers asked which category a book of Sebald's should be listed under, the author replied, ''All of them.'' ''Patience (After Sebald),'' Grant Gee's admiring documentary, is appropriately Sebaldian.", "headline": {"main": "A Writer Who Defied Categorization", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b72", "word_count": 760, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/patience/patience-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/patience/patience-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/patience/patience-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/arts/patience/patience-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "PATIENCE (AFTER SEBALD) (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SEBALD, W G"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GEE, GRANT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
