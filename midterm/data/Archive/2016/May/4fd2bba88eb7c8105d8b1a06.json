Al Armendariz, who oversaw federal environmental enforcement in five states, offered his resignation on Sunday in a letter to Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, saying he regretted his comments and did not want to jeopardize the agency's mission. Senior agency officials had upbraided Dr. Armendariz, who holds a doctorate in environmental engineering, for what they called his ''inappropriate and inaccurate'' comments about the agency's enforcement policy.", "headline": {"main": "E.P.A.
