At a previously unscheduled hearing on Friday, the judge leading the inquiry, Lord Justice Brian Leveson, said that he would grant the prime minister and six other senior cabinet ministers what is called core participant status, given to those who have a special interest in the outcome of the hearings. The status will be granted to the prime minister and members of his cabinet including the culture minister Jeremy Hunt, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who have both been targets of accusations of improper coziness with Mr. Murdoch and his executives.", "headline": {"main": "British Government Seeks Special Status at Hacking Inquiry"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d89147e", "word_count": 836, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CAMERON, DAVID"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BROOKS, REBEKAH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "COULSON, ANDY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEWS INTERNATIONAL LTD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEWS OF THE WORLD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEWS CORPORATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WIRETAPPING AND OTHER EAVESDROPPING DEVICES AND METHODS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
