Dress it as a waiter. Rearrange its face until its features slope to one side. Throw it across the room. Repeatedly. If that puppet came to life it might look something like the actor Tom Edden in the British comedy ''One Man, Two Guvnors,'' now on Broadway at the Music Box Theater. Although Mr. Edden has a scant 20 or so lines and just one big set piece in the two-and-a-half-hour show, he is doing some old-fashioned scene stealing and getting some of the biggest laughs of the season. Dressed in a ratty outfit, with a head of wispy white hair and heaps of makeup, Mr. Edden plays Alfie, a wild-eyed but slow-moving octogenarian waiter who is enlisted to help Francis (played by James Corden) serve his two bosses a pub lunch of soup, cold meats and chicken balls. The problem? It's Alfie's first day on the job. That and he has cataracts, is just this side of deaf, leans to one side, slurs his speech (it's that contorted mouth), has a pacemaker and the shakes. Or as the script describes it, he's ''old, slow and doddery.''", "headline": {"main": "Nimble Clown Playing Old In Rough-and-Tumble Role"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1751", "word_count": 841, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06EDDEN2/06EDDEN2-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06EDDEN2/06EDDEN2-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ONE MAN, TWO GUVNORS (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BEAN, RICHARD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "EDDEN, TOM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACTORS AND ACTRESSES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
