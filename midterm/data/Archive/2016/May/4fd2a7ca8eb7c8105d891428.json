The victims, killed by gunfire, clubs or knives, included a third-year medical student from Luxor and several young men from the Cairo neighborhood Abbaseya, where the fighting occurred, doctors said. It went for hours with no intervention from the authorities -- suggesting to some at least a degree of government complicity -- as opposing sides fought a pitched battle hurling stones and incendiary devices, turning a residential neighborhood into a war zone marked by scattered fires.", "headline": {"main": "Deadly Clashes in Egypt Throw the Presidential Race Into Disarray"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d891428", "word_count": 975, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/world/egypt/egypt-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/world/egypt/egypt-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/03/world/egypt/egypt-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/world/egypt/egypt-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Middle East", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "EGYPT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CAIRO (EGYPT)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA UNREST (2010- )"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
