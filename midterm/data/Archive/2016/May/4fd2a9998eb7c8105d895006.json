That would have been Mickey Mantle's, in Game 2 of the 1951 World Series, on the game's biggest stage, in front of 66,018 at Yankee Stadium. Then came the one Thursday night to closer Mariano Rivera, while he shagged fly balls in batting practice in a mostly empty stadium in Kansas City, Mo., one of the game's smallest stages. Both injuries were to the right knee, to Yankee immortals, and both occurred in the outfield. But the parallels end there. The injuries may be better thought of as bookends: Mantle's injury came at the beginning of a career plagued by them, while Rivera's comes near the end of a career relatively free of them. Mantle's injury probably robbed him of the hope to become the game's greatest statistical performer, while Rivera's injury may have robbed his magnificent career only of one final flourish.", "headline": {"main": "Mantle's Knee Injury Was Just the Start"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895006", "word_count": 672, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/sports/mantle/mantle-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/sports/mantle/mantle-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Baseball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "RIVERA, MARIANO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MANTLE, MICKEY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK YANKEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPORTS INJURIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
