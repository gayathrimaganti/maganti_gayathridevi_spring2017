Ms. Putman, 47, has designed furniture for Fermob, Emeco and Serralunga as well as the Le Rivage hotel in Hong Kong. And last week, she was in town to introduce a line of lighting created in collaboration with Lalique. The 11-piece Collection Orgue includes sconces, chandeliers and pendant lamps as well as desk, table and floor lamps that all incorporate satin-finished faceted crystal cylinders, which ''recall old forms and old shapes, like what Ren\u00e9 Lalique designed for the ship the Normandie in the 1930s,'' Ms. Putman said. Prices range from $1,900 for a chrome lamp (minus the lampshade) to $130,500 for a large gilded chandelier (the medium size, in chrome, is $95,000).", "headline": {"main": "A Classic Collaboration", "kicker": "CURRENTS | LIGHTING"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1709", "word_count": 146, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/garden/03LIGHTING/03LIGHTING-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/garden/03LIGHTING/03LIGHTING-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Home & Garden", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PUTMAN, OLIVIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LALIQUE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LIGHTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAMPS AND LAMPSHADES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
