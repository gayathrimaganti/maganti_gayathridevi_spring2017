The charge stemmed from a rally held last month, where the campaigner, Nikolai Alekseyev, carried a poster that said: ''Homosexuality is not a perversion. What is a perversion is field hockey and ice dancing.'' The St. Petersburg law is the model for a bill that has been submitted to the lower house of Parliament, which could be applied nationwide if approved. Mr. Alekseyev said he would appeal the verdict.", "headline": {"main": "Russia: Gay Rights Activist Fined", "kicker": "WORLD BRIEFING | EUROPE"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b173c", "word_count": 104, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ALEKSEYEV, NIKOLAI"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "RUSSIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINES (PENALTIES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOMOSEXUALITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
