That clip showed Clemens saying that his lawyers had advised him not to talk to George J. Mitchell for Mitchell's investigation of performance-enhancing drug use in baseball. Prosecutors said those comments contradicted what Clemens told Congress in 2008 when he testified that he had ''no idea'' Mitchell wanted to speak to him.", "headline": {"main": "Judge Bans Key Portion Of Interview With Clemens", "kicker": "ROUNDUP"}, "_id": "4fd2ae288eb7c8105d89c682", "word_count": 452, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Baseball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PETTITTE, ANDY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WALTON, REGGIE B"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CLEMENS, ROGER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MCNAMEE, BRIAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOPING (SPORTS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STEROIDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MITCHELL REPORT (BASEBALL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DECISIONS AND VERDICTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PERJURY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
