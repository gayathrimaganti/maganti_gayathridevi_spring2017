You make your decisions about floors and walls, and then weeks become months become, in some instances, years. And you realize that even when taste is a given, patience is a virtue. In this issue we feature homes that are a testament to the consistency and tenacity of their owners. For Francis Upritchard and Martino Gamper, as we learn in Marina Cashdan's profile, it was a matter of rethinking a curious apartment with no real features (and in a London housing project, no less) over time, when their artistic careers permitted, and with the help of resourceful, clever compatriots. Then there are Jason Schmidt and Bill Mullen's majestic portraits of New York style setters who dress like their sofas. Finally, in the case of Jon Rosen and Tiina Laakkonen, it was the decision to build from scratch a Scandinavian-inspired compound in Amagansett, N.Y., that was, soup to nuts, of their imagining. And did it drag on? Well, a bit. Actually, Laakkonen's journey to this house began long ago, before she met Rosen, and probably before she'd ever heard of Amagansett. I first met her when we worked together at British Vogue in the mid-1990s. She wore McQueen and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons evening gowns to the office, often topped off with a Philip Treacy hat. She had come to Vogue from being an assistant of Karl Lagerfeld's at Chanel. She had been shot by William Klein. Her boyfriend at the time was a rock star. We used to ''preview'' the Manolo Blahnik sample sale together, and I remember once her telling me in the too-expensive black cab ride from Mayfair to Chelsea that her dream was to one day open a small housewares store in which she could sell Finnish ceramics and wooden spoons and hand-loomed dish towels. It seemed so unlikely. Did she even cook? Did I cook? We were en route to buy severely discounted gladiator sandals in zebra and tartan. I was confused. But Tiina Laakkonen wasn't. She knew that her passion for design grew from a single tree with many branches to climb. This summer she will open her small shop, Tiina, in the Hamptons, selling almost exactly the items she'd rattled off to me 16 years ago. It's a tribute to taste and patience and vision, all of which she has in spades.", "headline": {"main": "Editor's Choice"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c652", "word_count": 402, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/t-magazine/06edletter/06edletter-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/t-magazine/06edletter/06edletter-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "T Magazine", "keywords": [], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
