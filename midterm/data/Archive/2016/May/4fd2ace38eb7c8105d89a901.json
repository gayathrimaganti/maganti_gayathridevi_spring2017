But there was little reflection last week by the board of News Corporation, which met quickly the day after the committee's report and announced ''its full confidence in Rupert Murdoch's fitness and support for his continuing to lead News Corporation into the future as its chairman and C.E.O.'' before the ink was even dry on the report. (While the board expressed unanimous support for Mr. Murdoch, it's worth noting there were no such words for his son James.)", "headline": {"main": "News Corp.
