That is what Matt Friedman, the gentle but determined hero of Lanford Wilson's Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning ''Talley's Folly,'' wants to believe. Shortly after he makes that assertion, though, he learns that there can be many a wounding stumble on that dance floor. And it's hard to imagine a more vigorous metaphor for those missteps than a 42-year-old accountant in a three-piece suit trying to balance himself on ice skates on the wooden floor of a broken-down Victorian boathouse. Until the Hudson Stage Company's charming new production, I had never seen ''Talley's Folly.'' Mr. Wilson, who died last year at 73, wrote a trilogy about the Talley family. I saw the first, ''The Fifth of July,'' with Christopher Reeve, Swoosie Kurtz and Cynthia Nixon, on Broadway, more than 30 years ago. In 1998 I reviewed a regional theater production of ''Talley & Son,'' the less well-received third play (originally presented as ''A Tale Told,'' in 1985). But somehow neither the 1979 Off Broadway production nor the 1980 Broadway run of ''Talley's Folly,'' starring Judd Hirsch and Trish Hawkins (much less the numerous regional revivals that followed), ever made it onto my calendar. It was impossible, though, to follow American theater and not know the play's reputation and its seemingly sentimental premise.", "headline": {"main": "At the Boathouse Seeking Love", "kicker": "ARTS | WESTCHESTER"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1aa5", "word_count": 835, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSWE1_SPAN/06ARTSWE1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSWE1_SPAN/06ARTSWE1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSWE1_SPAN/06ARTSWE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06ARTSWE1_SPAN/06ARTSWE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TALLEY'S FOLLY (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WHITE, MARGOT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FOSTER, DAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STONE, DANTON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WILSON, LANFORD"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WESTCHESTER COUNTY (NY)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WOODWARD HALL THEATER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HUDSON STAGE CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
