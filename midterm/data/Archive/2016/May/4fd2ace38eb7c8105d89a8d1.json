So when she heard a host on ''The Doctors,'' a syndicated TV show, say that a new treatment called Cellulaze can ''banish cellulite,'' she paid $6,500 for it. ''The fact that it's supposed to be a permanent solution was definitely what sold me,'' said Selina, who got a hefty discount because she agreed to be Exhibit A for a doctor-training session. In March, Selina grimaced as Dr. Barry DiBernardo, a plastic surgeon in Montclair, N.J., injected anesthetic liquid into her thighs, which had been marked with a tick-tack-toe grid: dimples colored red and bulging fat green. After making a few tiny incisions, Dr. DiBernardo passed a side-firing laser with a red-lighted tip under her skin in various directions as five other doctors watched. It made a muffled pop-pop-pop sound, not unlike a rattlesnake, as Selina's fat cells broke. Periodically, as the laser scorched a connective fiber anchoring skin into a dimple, Dr. DiBernardo, a clinical investigator, would exclaim, ''Oh, there, that was good, that got a good release.''", "headline": {"main": "Zeroing In On Cellulite"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a8d1", "word_count": 1514, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/fashion/03CELLULAZE/03CELLULAZE-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/fashion/03CELLULAZE/03CELLULAZE-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 300, "url": "images/2012/05/03/fashion/03CELLULAZE/03CELLULAZE-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/fashion/03CELLULAZE/03CELLULAZE-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 300, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Fashion & Style", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "CYNOSURE INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LASER (LIGHT AMPLIFICATION BY STIMULATED EMISSION OF RADIATION)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLASTIC SURGERY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LIPOSUCTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SKIN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN AND GIRLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SURGERY AND SURGEONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
