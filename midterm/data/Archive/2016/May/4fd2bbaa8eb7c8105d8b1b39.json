Some islanders theorize that the coloring could be a result of excess sun exposure, or a diet rich in fish. Another explanation is that the blondness was inherited from distant ancestors -- European traders and explorers who came to the islands. But that's not the case, researchers now report. The gene variant responsible for blond hair in the islanders is distinctly different from the gene that causes blond hair in Europeans.", "headline": {"main": "Island's Genetic Quirk: Dark Skin, Blond Hair", "kicker": "OBSERVATORY"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b39", "word_count": 283, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/science/08blond/08blond-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/science/08blond/08blond-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Science", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "SOLOMON ISLANDS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SCIENCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENETICS AND HEREDITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HAIR"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
