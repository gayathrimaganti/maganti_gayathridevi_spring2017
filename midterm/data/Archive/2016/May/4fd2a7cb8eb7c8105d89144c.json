One day was at his three-story home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where he has lived since 1983. Two female friends worked as his assistants, lighting his cigarettes and bringing him Champagne as he held forth volcanically behind a semicircular desk in his study. The other was at his favorite neighborhood restaurant, where he walked in, looked at the bartender, reacted as if stunned by her beauty for the first time, and kissed her hand. She seemed used to it. ''He's so committed to the moment and its infinite potential of possibilities'' said Bobby Zankel, the saxophonist, who has studied with Mr. Taylor and played in his ensembles off and on since the early 1970s. ''Like, what happened in the last moment is the past, and this present moment is all we got. That's how he feels about his music too. I've been with the guy a million times, and I've never even known him to listen to a tape of his own music. He just says, 'I know what happened.'
