Scotland Yard reacted immediately by saying it would continue its efforts to hunt down the killer. After an eight-day inquest that has thrown an uncomfortable spotlight on MI6, Britain's secret intelligence service, the coroner, Dr. Fiona Wilcox, said the death of Gareth Williams, 31, a Welsh-born mathematician involved in top-secret code-breaking work, appeared to have been ''unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated.''
