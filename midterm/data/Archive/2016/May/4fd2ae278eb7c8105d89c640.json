(Yale University, $20.) Now in his 80s, the distinguished literary scholar offers a kind of summing-up of ideas, born of his urge ''to say in one place most of what I have learned to think about how influence works in imaginative literature.'' Between exegeses of Shakespeare, Whitman and others, Bloom reminisces on his rise from bleak poverty and on his first years at Yale in the 1950s. THE FORGOTTEN WALTZ, by Anne Enright. (Norton, $15.95.) A metaphor for Ireland's recent economic woes, Enright's novel traces the complications wrought by an extramarital affair in Dublin. As emotional and financial strains take their toll on two marriages, her narrator -- the sharp, materialistic ''other woman'' -- sees heady passions give way to responsibility and regret.", "headline": {"main": "Paperback Row"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c640", "word_count": 512, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Books / Sunday Book Review", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "List"}
