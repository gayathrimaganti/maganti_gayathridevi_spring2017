In the decade since, Ms. Tena's combination of ferocity and sweetness -- with her swooping brows and penchant for salty language, she seems the kind of woman who would just as soon kick as hug you -- has landed her supporting roles as Nymphadora Tonks in the Harry Potter franchise and, more recently, as Osha in HBO's ''Game of Thrones.'' But perhaps no character comes as close to the real Ms. Tena, 27, as Morello, the lead singer of a post-punk girl band in David Mackenzie's ''Tonight You're Mine,'' to be released on Friday, her first turn as a star. Filmed over just four and a half days at T in the Park, the Scottish music festival, this romantic comedy required Ms. Tena to be handcuffed to Luke Treadaway, playing a California rocker, as their alter egos performed gigs and navigated unsteady relationships while searching for the key that would release them.", "headline": {"main": "She'd Rather Be Swinging On a Trapeze", "kicker": "SNAPSHOT | NATALIA"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c665", "word_count": 829, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SNAPSHOT/06SNAPSHOT-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06SNAPSHOT/06SNAPSHOT-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "GAME OF THRONES (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MACKENZIE, DAVID"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TENA, NATALIA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SCOTLAND"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Question"}
