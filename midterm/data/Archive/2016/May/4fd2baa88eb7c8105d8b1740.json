On Thursday, the second day of the fast, supporters were preparing a kale, apple and celery juice concoction for the protesters at the Northridge campus. The students have pledged to forgo solid food for at least a week, perhaps longer if the administration does not move to meet some of their demands, which include a five-year moratorium on student fee increases and a rollback of executive salaries to 1999 levels.", "headline": {"main": "At California State, Protesters Start a Fast"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1740", "word_count": 958, "multimedia": [{"height": 382, "url": "images/2012/05/06/us/CALSTATE/CALSTATE-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/us/CALSTATE/CALSTATE-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 382, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HUNGER STRIKES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TUITION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STRIKES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FASTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
