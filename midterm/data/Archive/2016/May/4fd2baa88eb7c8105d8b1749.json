They perch stiffly, arch their necks and hold their beaks high; their plumes are perfectly groomed, their bodies remarkably thin. There is no question they inhabit the higher branches of their kingdom, much like the diners chirping beside them. Fred's may not shout its position in the city's lunchtime pecking order like the testosterone-heavy Le Cirque or Four Seasons. But this aerie, designed for flagging shoppers, has slowly lured diners like Sofia Coppola, Barbara Walters, Christine C. Quinn and Hillary Rodham Clinton from more conventional spots to see and be seen.", "headline": {"main": "A Hidden Nest Atop Barneys To Make Deals", "kicker": "NEIGHBORHOOD JOINT | UPPER EAST SIDE"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1749", "word_count": 656, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06JOINT1/06JOINT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06JOINT1/06JOINT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06JOINT1/06JOINT1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06JOINT1/06JOINT1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UPPER EAST SIDE (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FRED'S AT BARNEYS NEW YORK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
