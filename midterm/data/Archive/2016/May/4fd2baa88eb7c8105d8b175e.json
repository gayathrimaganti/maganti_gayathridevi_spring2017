She began her career in the nervier sectors of French film, working with Catherine Breillat, Bertrand Bonelloand Christophe Honor\u00e9. Mr. Honor\u00e9's ''Belle Personne'' won her a C\u00e9sar (the French Oscar) nomination for most promising actress in 2009, and she has since made a considerable dent in the Hollywood consciousness, last year seducing Owen Wilson in ''Midnight in Paris'' and plotting to kill Tom Cruise in ''Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol.'' It doesn't hurt that fashion designers and editors love her (she was the face of a recent Prada campaign), and that the movie business is in her blood. (Her grandfather is a chairman of one major French film company, Path\u00e9, and her great-uncle is the president of another, Gaumont.)", "headline": {"main": "Royal Entrances For Budding Stars"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b175e", "word_count": 1906, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06BREAK1/06BREAK1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/arts/06BREAK1/06BREAK1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FAREWELL, MY QUEEN (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE INTOUCHABLES (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "COMPLIANCE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "OSLO, AUGUST 31ST (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LIE, ANDERS DANIELSEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TRIER, JOACHIM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HENRY, DWIGHT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SY, OMAR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DOWD, ANN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
