After a week of experiencing the sun-starved Norwegian midwinter, all dawn, dusk and oppressive darkness, I felt I knew where Munch's image of released hysteria was coming from. Since then ''The Scream'' has been subjected to the hard glare of the public spotlight. Two of the four existing versions of it have, at different times, been stolen from Oslo museums and later recovered. On Wednesday an 1895 pastel version of the picture sold for $119.9 million at Sotheby's in New York, setting an auction record and proving, yet again, that whatever shape the economy is in, there's no limit to private cash and art is a place where people like to park it.", "headline": {"main": "If I Had the Cash, I Wouldn't Buy That", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca3c", "word_count": 659, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04MUNCH/04MUNCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04MUNCH/04MUNCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MUNCH, EDVARD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SOTHEBY'S"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AUCTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
