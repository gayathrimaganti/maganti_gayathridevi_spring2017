The top chart shows the percentage of jobs held by public sector employees since 1957. In recent decades, that proportion has tended to fall under Democratic presidents and rise under Republican ones. The other charts show the annual rate of change in the number of jobs during four-year presidential terms, and through August during President Obama\u2019s administration. While private sector employment is now a little higher than it was when Mr. Obama took office, overall government employment has declined at a rate not seen during any full presidential term since the reductions that followed the end of World War II.", "headline": {"seo": "Off the Charts: The Job Score", "main": "Off the Charts: The Job Score"}, "_id": "53fadf4d38f0d8431914daa7", "word_count": "254", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-09-14T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Business Day", "keywords": [{"value": "Labor and Jobs", "name": "subject", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Presidents and Presidency (US)", "name": "subject", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Interactive Feature"}
