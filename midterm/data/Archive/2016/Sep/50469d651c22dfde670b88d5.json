Interested in a well maintained, one-owner elementary with playground and orchard view? Or a 1990s charmer, now used for teaching second through fifth grades but convenient to shopping and the Interstate?

Music and art classes were eliminated last year. Teaching positions have been reduced through attrition and layoffs loom in years ahead, with state aid showing few signs of a robust comeback.", "headline": {"main": "School District Bets Future on Real Estate", "kicker": "GERVAIS JOURNAL"}, "_id": "50469d651c22dfde670b88d5", "word_count": 883, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/09/05/us/CLASSROOM-3/CLASSROOM-3-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/09/05/us/CLASSROOM-3/CLASSROOM-3-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/09/05/us/CLASSROOM-3/CLASSROOM-3-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/09/05/us/CLASSROOM-3/CLASSROOM-3-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-09-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "GERVAIS (ORE)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "OREGON"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECESSION AND DEPRESSION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REAL ESTATE AND HOUSING (RESIDENTIAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION (K-12)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REAL ESTATE (COMMERCIAL)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
