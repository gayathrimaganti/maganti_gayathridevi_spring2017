Montreal police officials said that the shootings took place near a back door of the meeting hall. As Ms. Marois was stating her ''firm conviction that Quebec needs to become a sovereign country,'' she was pulled off the stage by two plainclothes officers.", "headline": {"main": "Shootings Mar Victory Party for Separatists in Quebec"}, "_id": "5046cf0d1c22dfde670b8932", "word_count": 1023, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/09/06/world/canada1/canada1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2012/09/06/world/canada1/canada1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/09/06/world/canada1/canada1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/09/06/world/canada1/canada1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-09-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Americas", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MAROIS, PAULINE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CANADA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "QUEBEC PROVINCE (CANADA)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "OTTAWA (ONTARIO)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LIBERAL PARTY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PARTI QUEBECOIS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
