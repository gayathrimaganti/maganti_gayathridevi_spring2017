What's novel about the program is that while Citigroup will provide most of the capital, it will not disburse it. Instead, it will rely on Next Street, a self-described \"merchant bank,\" to underwrite loans to businesses that Next Street deems capable of rapid growth. If the initiative succeeds, it could serve as a model for similar programs around the country.", "headline": {"main": "Citibank Tries a New Approach to Small-Business Lending", "kicker": "You're the Boss"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e88eb7c8105d8eb833", "word_count": 1180, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T12:17:18Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "National Community Reinvestment Coalition", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Small Business", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Banking and Financial Institutions", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
