The settlement is a result of a lawsuit filed by preservationists in July accusing the building's owner, Vornado Realty Trust -- abetted by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission - of disregarding restrictions intended to protect the interior. The settlement also provides that the landmarks commission expand its designation of the interior to include a black granite wall that is part of the former vault space.", "headline": {"main": "Preservationists Win a Battle Over Former Manufacturers Hanover Trust Building", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c48eb7c8105d8eb297", "word_count": 341, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-08T13:42:49Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Skidmore, Owings & Merrill", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bunshaft, Gordon", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Lever House (NYC Restaurant)", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bertoia, Harry", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bankoff, Simeon", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Gratz, Roberta Brandes", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Vornado Realty Trust|VNO|NYSE", "rank": "15"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Historic Buildings and Sites", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "JPMorgan Chase & Company|JPM|NYSE", "rank": "14"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Historic Districts Council", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Fifth Avenue (NYC)", "rank": "13"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JPMorgan Chase & Company", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Landmarks Preservation Commission", "rank": "9"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Vornado Realty Trust", "rank": "12"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
