But those plans have been scrapped, the Mikhailovsky's agent said on Thursday, because American Ballet Theater exercised a no-compete clause involving those very same dancers. Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev also happen to dance with Ballet Theater - Ms. Osipova as a principal and Mr. Vasiliev as a guest. A Ballet Theater spokeswoman did not immediately return a phone message on Thursday.", "headline": {"main": "American Ballet Theater Thwarts Mikhailovsky's Summer Plans", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a33c8eb7c8105d8ec3f2", "word_count": 331, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T15:53:13Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Osipova, Natalia", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "McKenzie, Kevin", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Duato, Nacho", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Vasiliev, Ivan", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Dancing", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "American Ballet Theater", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Mikhailovsky Opera and Ballet Theater", "rank": "8"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
