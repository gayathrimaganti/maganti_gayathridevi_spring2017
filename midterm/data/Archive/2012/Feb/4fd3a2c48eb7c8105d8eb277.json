Word of his condition traveled hundreds of miles south and soon reached his son, Capt. J. Lewis Spalding, at Camp Barnes, located on the Virginia side of the Potomac River opposite Washington. On Feb. 6, Spalding requested a furlough to go home and care for his father. He had not been home in months; an energetic and ambitious young man, he had been busy rising through the military ranks.
