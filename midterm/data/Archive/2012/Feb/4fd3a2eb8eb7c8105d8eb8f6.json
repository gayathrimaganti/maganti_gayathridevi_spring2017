They clearly weren't part of the crowd that walked out of that film over the summer. (So far, Pat Kiernan, who thinks \"The Artist\" will go all the way, and Randy Jackson, with his vote for \"The Help,\" are outliers.) Now comes the \"Nightline\" anchor Terry Moran to add his thumbs-up for \"Tree of Life.\" Mr. Moran also picked Mr. Malick for best director and the film's Emmanuel Lubezki for best cinematographer. The rest of his choices range over the field and include Mr. Eugenides's choice for permanent Oscar, Meryl Streep, for best actress, and Melissa McCarthy for supporting actress.
