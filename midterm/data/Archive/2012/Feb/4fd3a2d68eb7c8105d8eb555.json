Earlier this week, it put the University of Nebraska on \"probation\" for two years, and fined it $38,000 for what the N.C.A.A. described as a \"major\" violation of the rules. Apparently for some years the university bookstore had been giving the school's athletes not just the books that were required for their courses, but also the books that their professors recommended as helpful reading for their classes. Incredibly, the organization that insists on calling college football players \"student athletes\" does not allow them to get anything but the required books under the terms of their scholarships. Giving them the recommended books is against the rules.\u00a0 Although my \"stupid rules\" contest is going to run into next week-and we've gotten some great entries!-this one is going to be hard to top.
