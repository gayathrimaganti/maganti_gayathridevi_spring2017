After Andrea Bruce, on assignment for The New York Times, bent over double and eased her way through the low door of the hut, she counted 17 women, including the mother, plus the boy's 10-year-old sister Feroza, and the father, in a one-room house no larger than a normal-size bedroom. It was, she said, even colder inside than outside, where at least there was the weak morning sun.", "headline": {"main": "Uncovering the Sadness of Young Deaths", "kicker": "Lens"}, "_id": "4fd3a30c8eb7c8105d8ebd39", "word_count": 1330, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-08T19:00:36Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
