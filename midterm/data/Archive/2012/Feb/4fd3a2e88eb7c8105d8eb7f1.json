When Von Furstenberg and Current/Elliott's Serge Azria set out to create a printed denim capsule made of skinny jeans, 1980s-era pencil skirts and wrap dresses, it wasn't the obvious - \"Current/Elliott knows denim,\" and \"Diane is the queen of prints\" - that made for such a seamless co-creation. Rather it was the two brands' shared love for what Azria calls \"Europe's rock 'n' roll era.\" Out this month are cool screen-printed slacks (starting at $258) and skinny skirts ($229).", "headline": {"main": "Now Collaborating | Diane Von Furstenberg + Current/Elliot", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e88eb7c8105d8eb7f1", "word_count": 124, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T16:18:14Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "von Furstenberg, Diane", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
