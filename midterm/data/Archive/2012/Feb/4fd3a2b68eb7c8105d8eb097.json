Jonathan Franzen writes in the preface that one of the books - \"The Custom of the Country\" - \"is the earliest novel to portray an America . . . to which the Kardashians, Twitter and Fox News would come as no surprise.\" \"Dreaming in French\" by Alice Kaplan (The University of Chicago Press, $26) traces the formative years that Jacqueline Kennedy, Susan Sontag and Angela Davis spent in Paris. Katie Baron's \"Stylists\" (Laurence King, $50) is a handy who's who of fashion's best dressers, from the \"editorial genius\" Marie-Am\u00e9lie Sauv\u00e9 to the \"incendiary\" Lady Gaga collaborationist Nicola Formichetti. In \"The Gentrification of the Mind\" (University of California Press, $28), Sarah Schulman argues that AIDS not only destroyed a vibrant queer community in New York, but it also brought about a more mainstream, culturally sterile city.", "headline": {"main": "Bookshelf", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2b68eb7c8105d8eb097", "word_count": 162, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-08T13:30:27Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kaplan, Alice", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Formichetti, Nicola", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Schulman, Sarah", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Wharton, Edith", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Paris (France)", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
