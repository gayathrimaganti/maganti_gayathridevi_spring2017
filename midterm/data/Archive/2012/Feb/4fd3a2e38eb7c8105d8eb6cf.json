A rarely enforced California law, the only one of its type in the country, requires anyone reselling a piece of fine art who lives in the state, or who sells the art there for $1,000 or more, to pay the artist 5 percent of the resale price. The law, on the books since 1977, aroused renewed attention this fall after Chuck Close, Laddie John Dill and the estate of the sculptor Robert Graham brought class action suits against Christie's, Sotheby's and E-bay.", "headline": {"main": "Dealer Settles with Artist in California Royalties Case", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e38eb7c8105d8eb6cf", "word_count": 291, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T14:27:21Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "unknown", "value": "Sotheby's|BID|NYSE", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Royalties", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Mark Grotjahn", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Art", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Valentine, Dean", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Suits and Litigation", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Christie's", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Los Angeles Times", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Sotheby's", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "California", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
