Mr. Jackson chose that song, with music and lyrics by Bret McKenzie, over \"Real in Rio,\" the theme from the animated feature \"Rio\" in the nytimes.com Oscar contest. He also chose the score from \"Hugo\" to win the Oscar in its category. A bass player, producer, former record label executive and now TV tastemaker, Mr. Jackson also favors \"The Help\" in this year's race. He chose that film to win three awards, including best picture, best actress (Viola Davis) and best supporting actress (Jessica Chastain).
