Championship teams in various categories. The 1920s teams are not included, because of severe differences in the game and league.In this installment, we rank the kickers. When judging kickers, you have to grade on a curve: converting 10 of 18 field goals in the 1950s was Pro Bowl-worthy, while going 10 of 18 today means a trip to the waiver wire, or the Redskins. Early kickers also played other positions, and you have to award some credit to players who kicked extra points for their own touchdowns. The Giants acquired a few great kickers near the end of their careers, so the following rankings are based on their performances for Giants championship teams, not their career accomplishments.", "headline": {"main": "The Giants History Countdown: Kickers", "kicker": "The Fifth Down"}, "_id": "4fd3a2f88eb7c8105d8eba58", "word_count": 765, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-01T13:00:47Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "San Francisco 49ers", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Football", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "New York Giants", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Tynes, Lawrence", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Strong, Ken", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Chicago Bears", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Cleveland Browns", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Detroit Lions", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Green Bay Packers", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "National Football League", "rank": "9"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Washington Redskins", "rank": "12"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
