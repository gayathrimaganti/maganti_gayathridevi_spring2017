Weeks or maybe months before Fox would have announced the change, the program's executive producer, Nigel Lythgoe, disclosed in a Twitter message on Sunday that the network had canceled the results show for the season scheduled to start in May. \"I will have to change the format,\" he added. Fox previously split the show into two nights, revealing the weekly results a day after the competitions. The eighth season, last year, lost ground to another summer competition, \"America's Got Talent\" on NBC, but it remains an important piece of Fox's schedule. A Fox scheduling executive said on Twitter on Monday that the reasons for the shortening would be explained \"in due time.\"", "headline": {"main": "New Reality on Fox: Hurry Up and Dance", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e38eb7c8105d8eb6bf", "word_count": 124, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-02T14:42:14Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Reality Television", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Dancing", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Lythgoe, Nigel", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
