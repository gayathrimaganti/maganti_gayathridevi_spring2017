To be fair, the promo, made with the imprimatur of FunnyOrDie, also has shades of \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"The Princess Bride,\" at least in Mr. Crystal's hair and makeup (although he looks more like Carol Kane). If it's a sign of the kind of telecast we'll see next month, we can bet on highly referential, high-production-value montages and familiar humor.", "headline": {"main": "Megan Fox and Josh Duhamel, but No Optimus Prime", "kicker": "Carpetbagger"}, "_id": "4fd3a2b18eb7c8105d8eae8c", "word_count": 152, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-06T13:15:30Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Grazer, Brian", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Fox, Megan", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Duhamel, Josh", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Murphy, Eddie", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Ratner, Brett", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
