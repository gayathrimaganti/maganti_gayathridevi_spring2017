Then came the financial crisis, touched off in part by gross recklessness on Wall Street. Then came the Great Recession, which threw millions of Americans out of work, hit downscale workers much harder than it did the college-educated, and sent the deficit spiraling upward to unprecedented heights.", "headline": {"main": "Return of the Repressed", "kicker": "Ross Douthat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2528eb7c8105d8ea1ff", "word_count": 540, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T11:38:44Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
