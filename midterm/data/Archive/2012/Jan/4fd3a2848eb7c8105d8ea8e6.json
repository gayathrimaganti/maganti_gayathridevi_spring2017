Though certain looks from this prefall collection, like the tall black and white riding boots paired with a belted drop-waist dress, felt quite Courr\u00e8ges-like, the slouchy pants, padded biker jacket, animal print intarsias and singular column dress (white, floor-length, with a tiny peplum high on the waist) kept things from going too retro. Here, the aforementioned boots (key) are worked into a look that slips as easily into the designer's oeuvre as it does alongside the label's classic box bag. The front piece on the sweater is mink and the skirt is leather with suede pockets.", "headline": {"main": "Just One Look | Celine", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2848eb7c8105d8ea8e6", "word_count": 123, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-09T16:00:30Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
