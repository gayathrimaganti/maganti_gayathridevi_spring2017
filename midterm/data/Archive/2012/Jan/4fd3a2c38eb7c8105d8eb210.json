Wilson is on camera a great deal, with a lot of close-ups, and of course the series is filmed in high definition\u00a0- so he and his makeup artist, Anita Gibson, pay close attention to his skincare regimen (especially since he has to shave daily). I got the whole grooming scoop for you gentlemen. And ladies, I think you'll find something of interest here, too!", "headline": {"main": "Face Time | Patrick Wilson", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c38eb7c8105d8eb210", "word_count": 1153, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-06T09:00:25Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
