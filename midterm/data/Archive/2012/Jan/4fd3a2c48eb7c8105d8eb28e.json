The season premiere of the series averaged 7.7 million total viewers over a two-hour period on Monday night, according to Nielsen data, down from the 9 million viewers who watched the 15th-season premiere last January. There was also a 17 percent drop in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic when compared with last year. This placed ABC a distant second in the overall ratings among the broadcast networks, behind the CBS Monday comedy block. CBS finished No. 1 in all ratings categories in every prime-time half-hour.", "headline": {"main": "Fewer Viewers Check Out 'The Bachelor' on ABC", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c48eb7c8105d8eb28e", "word_count": 100, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-03T15:29:02Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ABC Inc", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Television", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
