Today, with tickets available online and frequent-flier miles accruing with every credit-card purchase, fans can dare to dream a little more boldly.

It will be a trip of cheap hotels and high hopes, cramped rental cars and unexpectedly good seats at the game. The men - they will be joined by two pals in Milwaukee - have agreed to create a Titletown travelogue.
