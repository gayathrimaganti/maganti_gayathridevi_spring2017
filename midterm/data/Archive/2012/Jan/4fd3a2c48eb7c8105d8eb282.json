Along with the chain's original \"smashed'' four-ounce burger, pressed on the griddle to be thin and crisp, the new shop has a six-ounce Signature Steakburger made with organic beef and only gently pressed. And for the first time, there will be beer and wine. This sleek, 20-seat spot has new self-service Coke machines to permit custom flavorings.", "headline": {"main": "Steak 'n Shake Comes to New York", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c48eb7c8105d8eb282", "word_count": 224, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-09T16:39:14Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Steak 'n Shake", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Shake Shack", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Meyer, Danny", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
