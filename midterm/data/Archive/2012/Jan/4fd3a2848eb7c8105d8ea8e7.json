Hence, the plastic tortoise kitten heels, the fabrics that make references to shag carpets and couches (her only resources) and the jackets made of a leather that's washed to look faux (she's just not that fancy). \"She's sweet looking but not dull,\" Henry said. And she has a terrific, intuitive sense of style, one that doesn't require money. Here, because he likes \"calm, strong, happy colors with metallics,\" is a yellow shearling jacket and skirt look paired with the coolest metallic pumps and matching camera bag. Anything but dull, indeed.", "headline": {"main": "Just One Look | Carven", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2848eb7c8105d8ea8e7", "word_count": 151, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T17:22:35Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Henry, Guillaume", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Arbus, Diane", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Nineteen Hundred Sixties", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Carven", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
