Was an asteroid impact more or less solely responsible for the catastrophic mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous geological period, 65 million years ago? Or were the dinosaurs already undergoing a long-term decline, and the asteroid was merely the coup de gr\u00e2ce? So three young researchers, led by Stephen L. Brusatte, a graduate student at Columbia University who is affiliated with the American Museum of Natural History, decided to test this hypothesis with a close examination of the fossil record over the 12 million years leading up to the mass extinction.", "headline": {"main": "Huge Asteroid Is Still the Central Villain in Dinosaurs' Extinction"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca86", "word_count": 594, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/science/08DINO_SPAN/08DINO-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/science/08DINO_SPAN/08DINO-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 370, "url": "images/2012/05/08/science/08DINO_SPAN/08DINO-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/science/08DINO_SPAN/08DINO-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 370, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Science", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NATURE COMMUNICATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PALEONTOLOGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ASTEROIDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DINOSAURS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
