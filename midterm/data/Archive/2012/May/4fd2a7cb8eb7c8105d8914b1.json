There were only 19 of them. A cynic might question how divorcing the casino magnate Steve Wynn two years earlier and taking half his business make your fortune self-made. For every person who says that, you can find another person who will say, ''Elaine was a major contributor to the success of that company.'' Did I create an environment that allowed him to thrive? Did I create an anchoring to the personality that made us have good equilibrium? That's what I'd say I hope my contribution is. Is that worth a billion dollars? I have no idea how to quantify that. How much credit for the success of Wynn Resorts would your former husband give you? It depends on his mood. I think that Steve would give me credit for a lot of things, absolutely, but there are also times when he may not give me credit. But that's emotions. Sometimes you can't compartmentalize it when you've had the kind of unique relationship we've had.", "headline": {"main": "Casino Queen", "kicker": "TALK"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914b1", "word_count": 768, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06talk/06talk-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06talk/06talk-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WYNN, ELAINE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "LAS VEGAS (NEV)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WYNN RESORTS LTD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CASINOS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
