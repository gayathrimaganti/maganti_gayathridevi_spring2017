He likes to talk of ''harmony'' and ''pragmatism'' and often quotes the poet and politician Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire about ''lucid hope.'' With a father on the far right and a social-worker mother, Mr. Hollande grew up on the edge of the 1968 protests that nearly overthrew the French government. They shocked him, but also politicized him, he said in a recent interview, making him understand that change was possible even in the France of Charles de Gaulle.", "headline": {"main": "In Race to French Presidency, the Tortoise Sets His Own Pace"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1767", "word_count": 1173, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/world/france/france-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/world/france/france-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 312, "url": "images/2012/05/06/world/france/france-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/world/france/france-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 312, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SARKOZY, NICOLAS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HOLLANDE, FRANCOIS"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
