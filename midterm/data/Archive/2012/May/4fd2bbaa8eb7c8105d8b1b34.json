The spokesman, Yuval Harel, said that Shaul Mofaz, the newly elected head of the centrist Kadima Party, would become a special minister in Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet ''in charge of the process with the Palestinians.'' Two other conditions of the agreement, which Mr. Harel said would be announced at a 10:30 a.m. news conference on Tuesday, were that the Parliament would pass legislation to require national or military service of all Israeli citizens, including ultra-Orthodox Jews, and to overhaul the electoral process itself. The agreement is scheduled to run until late next year.", "headline": {"main": "Leader of Israel Centrist Party Kadima Agrees to Join Netanyahu's Coalition"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b34", "word_count": 688, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/world/NETANYAHU/NETANYAHU-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/world/NETANYAHU/NETANYAHU-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 370, "url": "images/2012/05/08/world/NETANYAHU/NETANYAHU-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/world/NETANYAHU/NETANYAHU-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 370, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Middle East", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MOFAZ, SHAUL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NETANYAHU, BENJAMIN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ISRAEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "KADIMA PARTY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LIKUD PARTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
