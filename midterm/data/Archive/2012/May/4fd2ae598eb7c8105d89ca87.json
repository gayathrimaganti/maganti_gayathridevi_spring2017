He had always been a Yankee, as a player and a coach, but this is his fifth season out of pinstripes. His new legacy is steadily growing. Mattingly is the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who at 18-10 are tied with the Washington Nationals for the best record in the National League. In the visitors' dugout on Friday, before a series at Wrigley Field, he said he never wondered how his life would have unfolded if the Yankees had hired him, instead of Joe Girardi, to replace Joe Torre after the 2007 season.", "headline": {"main": "Raised a Yankee, Mattingly Is Happy to Be a Dodger"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca87", "word_count": 1230, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mattingly-pic/07mattingly-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mattingly-pic/07mattingly-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 345, "url": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mattingly-pic/07mattingly-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mattingly-pic/07mattingly-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 345, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Baseball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MATTINGLY, DON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KEMP, MATT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GIRARDI, JOE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LOS ANGELES DODGERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COACHES AND MANAGERS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
