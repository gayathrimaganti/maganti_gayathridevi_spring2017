Knocked back on their heels and facing a 13-point deficit heading into the fourth quarter, the Thunder showed a rare pedigree and poise for such a young team. They clawed back with a 26-10 run led by James Harden and highlighted by a flurry of dunks and clutch jump shots, before cruising through the final minutes for a 103-97 victory that ended this Western Conference quarterfinal series in four games.", "headline": {"main": "The Mavericks Are Swept Off Their Throne by the Thunder", "kicker": "THUNDER 103, MAVERICKS 97"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895047", "word_count": 815, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Pro Basketball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HARDEN, JAMES"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DURANT, KEVIN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DALLAS MAVERICKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLAYOFF GAMES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
