Known as tepuis, or tabletop mountains, they are typically ringed by sheer cliffs that rise thousands of feet from the surrounding lowland jungles. Instead of peaks, tepuis have enormous flat expanses at their tops. To reach the tops of many tepuis, the only choices are scaling the cliffs or flying in a helicopter. For all their isolation, the tops of tepuis are not barren. They are like islands in the sky, covered with low forests and shrublands that support a diversity of animals likes frogs and lizards. Many of the species that live on top of the tepuis are found nowhere else on the planet.", "headline": {"main": "It's Not So Lonely at the Top: Ecosystems Thrive High in the Sky"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914d4", "word_count": 949, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Science", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "AMAZON JUNGLE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EVOLUTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FROGS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIODIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DNA (DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
