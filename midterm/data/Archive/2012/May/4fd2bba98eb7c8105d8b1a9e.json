Though Jacobs deserves her own namesake street, she will be getting the next best thing this weekend when the Municipal Art Society hosts nearly 70 free walking tours conducted by neighborhood residents in all five boroughs. The Jane's Walk tours, which began in 2007 in Toronto, her adopted city, and spread to New York last year, will be conducted around the world on Saturday and Sunday to honor the legacy and life of the woman who personified urbanism.", "headline": {"main": "Touring the City With Fresh Eyes"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a9e", "word_count": 823, "multimedia": [{"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04JANE3_SPAN/04JANE3_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04JANE3_SPAN/04JANE3_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JACOBS, JANE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MUNICIPAL ART SOCIETY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WALKING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
