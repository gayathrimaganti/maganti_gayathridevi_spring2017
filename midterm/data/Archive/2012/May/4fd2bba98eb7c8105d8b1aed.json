A. Dickey hurled the rosin bag at the mound, disgusted with himself despite emphatic applause from the 29,107 fans at Citi Field. Dickey was three outs from a shutout, but he had to settle for his fourth victory of the season when Manager Terry Collins removed him after he allowed a run-scoring double in the ninth. ''It leaves a sour taste in my mouth simply because I knew I have an expectation of myself in that situation, and that is not it,'' Dickey said Sunday after the Mets' 3-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. ''Sometimes when I don't meet that expectation, it's tough to swallow, even in the midst of a good outing.''", "headline": {"main": "Tough on Batters; Harder on Himself", "kicker": "METS 3, DIAMONDBACKS 1"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1aed", "word_count": 800, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mets-pic/07mets-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mets-pic/07mets-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 345, "url": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mets-pic/07mets-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/07/sports/07mets-pic/07mets-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 345, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Baseball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MURPHY, DANIEL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TEJADA, RUBEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DICKEY, R A"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRANCISCO, FRANK"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK METS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
