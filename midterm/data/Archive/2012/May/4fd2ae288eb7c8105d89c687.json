Faced with financial uncertainties and a pressing need to modernize, the president of the New York Public Library system, Anthony Marx, has put forward a $300 million proposal to renovate the flagship building. The plans, which are still evolving, sound both necessary and forward-thinking in this digital era. But the library's overseers have to take care that they preserve the essence of this cultural landmark. Mr. Marx and the city must make certain that the renovation provides the widest possible public access to the library's collection. So far, the city has promised $150 million, and the library must come up with the balance. The plan calls for selling the Mid-Manhattan branch and the Science, Industry and Business Library and folding their collections into the central branch.", "headline": {"main": "A Library for the Future", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "_id": "4fd2ae288eb7c8105d89c687", "word_count": 290, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MARX, ANTHONY W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FOSTER, NORMAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND SITES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTORATION AND RENOVATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial"}
