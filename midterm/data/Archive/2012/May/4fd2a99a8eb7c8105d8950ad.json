When I was a green freelance writer for The New York Times, for example, suddenly I became a candidate for a staff position. And I got it, only later to learn that Craig had pulled the strings. Astonishingly, after only nine months at the paper, I was offered the job of restaurant critic. Again, it was Craig working behind the scenes. And there were many more examples. I suppose the closest I came to intimacy was the day I asked him to lunch in order to elicit advice concerning the job. A little emotional back story: Craig's mansion of woes had many rooms, one of which centered on his amorous relationship with a certain retired pediatrician named Jim. Jim lived in Florida with his unsuspecting (until she suspected) wife. Consequently, the two saw each other only occasionally. This is about all I knew, or cared to know.", "headline": {"main": "Accepting a Seat at an Exclusive Table of Friends"}, "_id": "4fd2a99a8eb7c8105d8950ad", "word_count": 644, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLAIBORNE, CRAIG"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
