There was the horrifying moment last July when he tossed a ball to a fan, who fell to his death over a too-short railing trying to catch it. The World Series then delivered a crushing competitive blow as the Rangers blew an all-but-certain victory in Game 6. The offseason brought an ugly relapse into alcoholism. All of which makes Hamilton's four-homer game on Tuesday night that much more mesmerizing because Hamilton is a living, breathing poster for the full range of human emotion. If he weren't real, you get the feeling Maurice Sendak might have made him up. He is definitely a wild thing. Of course, you know none of that if you just watch Hamilton's ludicrously easy swing as he launched all four balls over the fence. His effort might be among the best of the 16 four-homer games in history, writes Cliff Corcoran on SI.com, and it had writers like Richard Durrett of ESPN.com and Ken Rosenthal of Foxsports.com, reaching for their thesauruses for different ways to say wow. When you take into account all of who Hamilton is, as Jeff Passan writes on Yahoo.com, the combination of incredibly talented, likeable player and troubled alcoholic makes him fascinating. As Richard Justice writes on MLB.com, Hamilton inspires people with both sides of his story.", "headline": {"main": "Swing Fever", "kicker": "LEADING OFF"}, "_id": "4fd2bbab8eb7c8105d8b1ba6", "word_count": 771, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/sports/09leadingoff-pic/09leadingoff-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/sports/09leadingoff-pic/09leadingoff-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 370, "url": "images/2012/05/09/sports/09leadingoff-pic/09leadingoff-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/sports/09leadingoff-pic/09leadingoff-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 370, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-09T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "NOEL, NERLENS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KARL, GEORGE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HAMILTON, JOSH"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "COLLINS, DOUG"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASKETBALL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
