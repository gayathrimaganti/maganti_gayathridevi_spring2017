The union filed a grievance Thursday night arguing that broad language contained in the collective bargaining agreement prohibits Goodell from disciplining players for conduct committed before Aug. 4, 2011, the day the C.B.A. was signed. That would eliminate the first two years of the three-year bounty program that the N.F.L. contends was run in New Orleans, including some of the most troublesome allegations -- that the defensive captain Jonathan Vilma offered $10,000 if hits knocked Brett Favre and Kurt Warner out of playoff games in 2010.", "headline": {"main": "Union Files Grievance Over Bounty Suspensions"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1aad", "word_count": 687, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Pro Football", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HARGROVE, ANTHONY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOODELL, ROGER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW ORLEANS SAINTS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS ASSN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOTBALL"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
