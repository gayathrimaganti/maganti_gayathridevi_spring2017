Andrew M. Cuomo, seeking to strengthen the state's chronically weak response to abuse of disabled people who live in publicly financed homes, plans this week to propose creating an agency dedicated to investigating problems with the care of nearly one million vulnerable New Yorkers. The new law enforcement and oversight agency would monitor those in state or private care who have developmental disabilities like autism or cerebral palsy, mental illnesses including schizophrenia, and other conditions, among them traumatic brain injuries, that put them at risk. The agency would employ a special prosecutor and would be granted subpoena power and the authority to convene grand juries, according to a draft plan obtained by The New York Times.", "headline": {"main": "Cuomo Seeking Agency to Police Care of Disabled"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b2e", "word_count": 1209, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/nyregion/DISABLED/DISABLED-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/nyregion/DISABLED/DISABLED-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CUOMO, ANDREW M"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "OFFICE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ABUSE OF THE DISABLED"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
