Lillet Blanc was joined by red Lillet Rouge in 1962. This spring the drink has blossomed in pink. Lillet Ros\u00e9 is essentially the blanc with some added red fruit liqueurs and a little of the Rouge for color -- a medley that is refreshing, a little fruity and excellent for a Mother's Day toast. But it is also so easy on the palate that the label should warn that, at 34 proof, it not be mistaken for ros\u00e9 wine. Serving it on ice dilutes the alcohol. Lillet Ros\u00e9 is $15.99 for 750 milliliters at Astor Wines & Spirits, astorwines.com; $19.99 at Columbus Wines and Spirits, columbuswines.com; and $22 at drinkupNY.com.", "headline": {"main": "A Blossom That Mom Can Sip", "kicker": "FOOD STUFF"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b6d", "word_count": 144, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09STUFF_LILLET/09STUFF_LILLET-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09STUFF_LILLET/09STUFF_LILLET-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "WINES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTHER'S DAY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
