But for the filmmaker Amos Kollek, the depression and artistic stasis that followed the failure of his 2003 film, ''Happy End'' (also called ''Nowhere to Go but Up''), was best countered by once again picking up a camera.

The result of seven years of therapeutic self-absorption, ''Chronicling a Crisis'' documents Mr. Kollek's journey to regain emotional stability and reconnect with his craft. Hopping between the cities he knows best, New York and Jerusalem, he ponders his undefined spirituality (''never been religious; won't start now'') and unresolved issues with his nonagenarian father, Teddy Kollek, whose celebrated 28-year tenure as the mayor of Jerusalem left an indelible imprint on his son's psyche.", "headline": {"main": "Chronicling a Crisis", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c632", "word_count": 251, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 363, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN/04RDP_CHRONICLING_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 363, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "CHRONICLING A CRISIS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KOLLEK, AMOS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
