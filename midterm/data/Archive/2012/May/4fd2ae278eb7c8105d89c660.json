The reactor, at the Tomari plant on the northern island of Hokkaido, was shut down for legally mandated maintenance, said its operator, Hokkaido Electric. As Japan's 50 functional commercial reactors have been shut down one by one for maintenance, none have been restarted because of safety concerns since last year's Fukushima disaster.", "headline": {"main": "Last Reactor Of 50 in Japan Is Shut Down"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c660", "word_count": 309, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Asia Pacific", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "JAPAN"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "HOKKAIDO (JAPAN)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAPAN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI (2011)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SHUTDOWNS (INSTITUTIONAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI NUCLEAR POWER PLANT (JAPAN)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NUCLEAR ENERGY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
