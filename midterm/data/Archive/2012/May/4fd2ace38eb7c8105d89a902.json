We've heard them giving defensive testimony in Congressional hearings or issuing anodyne statements flanked by lawyers and image consultants. They typically repeat platitudes about investment, risk-taking and job creation with the veiled contempt that the nation doesn't understand their contribution. You get the sense that they're afraid to say what they really believe. What do the superrich say when the cameras aren't there? With that in mind, I recently met Edward Conard on 57th Street and Madison Avenue, just outside his office at Bain Capital, the private-equity firm he helped build into a multibillion-dollar business by buying, fixing up and selling off companies at a profit. Conard, who retired a few years ago at 51, is not merely a member of the 1 percent. He's a member of the 0.1 percent. His wealth is most likely in the hundreds of millions; he lives in an Upper East Side town house just off Fifth Avenue; and he is one of the largest donors to his old boss and friend, Mitt Romney.", "headline": {"main": "Are the Rich Worth a Damn?", "kicker": "THE MONEY ISSUE"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a902", "word_count": 4213, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06bain1/06bain1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06bain1/06bain1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 373, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06bain1/06bain1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06bain1/06bain1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 373, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES: WHY EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN TOLD ABOUT THE ECONOMY IS WRONG (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CONARD, EDWARD WALTER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROMNEY, MITT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BAIN CAPITAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ECONOMICS (THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INCOME INEQUALITY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
