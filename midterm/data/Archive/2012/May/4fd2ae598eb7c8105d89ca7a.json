They offered money. Seven thousand dollars to let the Keystone XL pipeline cross her family's 600-acre farm on its way from the Alberta tar sands to the refineries on the Gulf Coast. This was nothing new. Her grandfather bought the land, in northeast Texas, about a two-hour drive from Dallas and a quarter mile from the Oklahoma border, in 1948 and started growing wheat, corn and soy. Since then, pipeline companies have tried to lease rights to cross it many times. The Crawfords always managed to persuade them to find a way around their property.", "headline": {"main": "An Old Texas Tale Retold: the Farmer vs. the Oil Company"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca7a", "word_count": 1153, "multimedia": [{"height": 389, "url": "images/2012/05/08/us/PIPE-1/PIPE-1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/us/PIPE-1/PIPE-1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 389, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CRAWFORD, JULIA TRIGG"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "TEXAS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRANSCANADA CORPORATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PIPELINES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KEYSTONE PIPELINE SYSTEM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EMINENT DOMAIN"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
