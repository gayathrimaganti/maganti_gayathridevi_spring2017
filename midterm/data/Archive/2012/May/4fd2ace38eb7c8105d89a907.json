Either Bodemeister was going to give the trainer Bob Baffert, fresh off a heart attack, his fourth Kentucky Derby victory, or I'll Have Another was going to give an anonymous jockey, Mario Gutierrez, one of the most unlikely victories in the 138 runnings of America's greatest horse race. For a mile and an eighth, Bodemeister had been breathtaking. He had come to Churchill Downs as the undisputed king of speed after leading every step of the way in the Arkansas Derby. It was why bettors in a record crowd of more than 165,000 had made him the 4-1 favorite. But the colt was taking on history -- he had not raced as a 2-year-old, and the last late starter to win the Derby was Apollo in 1882.", "headline": {"main": "Out of Nowhere to Win the Derby"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a907", "word_count": 966, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DERBY1/DERBY1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DERBY1/DERBY1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DERBY1/DERBY1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/sports/DERBY1/DERBY1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GUTIERREZ, MARIO"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BAFFERT, BOB"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "REDDAM, PAUL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CHURCHILL DOWNS INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HORSE RACING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "KENTUCKY DERBY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OUT OF NOWHERE (RACE HORSE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JOCKEYS, DRIVERS AND TRAINERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BODEMEISTER (RACE HORSE)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
