In the suit, which was brought against the company and a former supervisor, Ana Azocar, the government said the company submitted false claims between 2006 and 2010 for reimbursement for providing tutoring services under a federally financed program. ''The company and certain of its employees forged student signatures, falsified sign-in sheets and provided false certifications in order to deceitfully profit from a well-meaning program,'' the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, said in a statement.", "headline": {"main": "Princeton Review Is Accused Of Fraud in Tutoring Services"}, "_id": "4fd2bba88eb7c8105d8b1a16", "word_count": 334, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PRINCETON REVIEW"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FRAUDS AND SWINDLING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION (K-12)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TUTORS AND TUTORING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
