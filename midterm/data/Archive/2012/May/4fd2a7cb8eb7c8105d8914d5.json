Drug monitoring programs may help reduce supply, but will not reduce demand for these drugs. Nor will much be gained by urine testing pregnant women who are reluctant to disclose their drug use, because they fear -- with cause -- prosecution and/or loss of child custody. Indeed, it might make them more likely to avoid prenatal care or opt for abortion.", "headline": {"main": "Help For the Pregnant", "kicker": "LETTERS"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914d5", "word_count": 135, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Health", "keywords": [], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Letter"}
