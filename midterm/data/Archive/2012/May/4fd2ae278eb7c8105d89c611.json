Tribeca Enterprises, the parent of the Tribeca Film Festival, is teaming up with Maker Studios to create a channel on YouTube.com, named the Picture Show, that is to go live later this year. The channel on YouTube, which is part of Google, will be a home for online series and short films, rather than the feature-length movies that are released by Tribeca Film in theaters and on the video-on-demand channels on cable systems.", "headline": {"main": "YouTube and Kin Woo Marketers, Seeking to Siphon Dollars From TV", "kicker": "ADVERTISING"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c611", "word_count": 869, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Business Day / Media & Advertising", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "NBC UNIVERSAL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YOUTUBE.COM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRIBECA ENTERPRISES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WEB-ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ADVERTISING AND MARKETING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ONLINE ADVERTISING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "VIDEO RECORDINGS AND DOWNLOADS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
