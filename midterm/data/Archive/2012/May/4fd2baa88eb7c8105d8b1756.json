All of it, the remnants of factories and businesses gone bust, belongs to Mike Diamond, who has spent the last 50 years making a living in an industry that, for lack of a gentler term, might be called the going-broke business. On a recent morning, Diamond was leading a tour of his facility for a client named Gamal Omar, who had traveled to York, S.C., from Egypt for, among other things, some discount shopping. Omar owns a fabric-and-apparel-manufacturing business in 10th of Ramadan City, and like virtually everyone in the apparel business, he struggles with competition from Asia. Buying new machinery is out of Omar's budget, but older technologies bring productivity and quality problems. To remain competitive, he needs late-model textile machinery at used-car prices. And so he makes the trip to South Carolina about once each year.", "headline": {"main": "Anybody Want a $1 Million Pillowcase Machine?", "kicker": "IT'S THE ECONOMY"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1756", "word_count": 1296, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06economy1/06economy1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06economy1/06economy1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 470, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06economy1/06economy1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06economy1/06economy1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 470, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FACTORIES AND MANUFACTURING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SHUTDOWNS (INSTITUTIONAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEXTILES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
