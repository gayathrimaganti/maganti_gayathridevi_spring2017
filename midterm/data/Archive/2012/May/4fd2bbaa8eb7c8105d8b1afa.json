''Clean tech'' has been good in return. During the recession, it was one of the few sectors to add jobs. Costs of wind turbines and solar cells have fallen over the last five years, electricity from renewables has more than doubled, construction is under way on the country's first new nuclear power plant in decades. And the United States remains an important player in the global clean energy market.", "headline": {"main": "The End of Clean Energy Subsidies?", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1afa", "word_count": 500, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion / Sunday Review", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BREAKTHROUGH INSTITUTE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BROOKINGS INSTITUTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAX CREDITS, DEDUCTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WIND POWER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FEDERAL AID (US)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial"}
