The handoff couldn't have been more straightforward. In World at War, the 2008 iteration of the wildly popular Call of Duty series, the game designers, perhaps sensing that players were tiring of the pleasures of killing the soldiers of the Third Reich, introduced a new mode: Nazi zombies. Shooting already dead members of Hitler's army proved even more satisfying than doing the same to (digitally) living but historical Germans. Out with World War II, in with World War Z. The lineage isn't quite that simple, of course. Zombies have a long history in games, including seminal titles like Resident Evil (1996) and Wolfenstein 3D (1992), widely regarded as the original first-person shooter, which itself was about fighting some kind of undead/Nazi hybrid. And apocalyptic fiction has become unavoidable in post-Sept. 11 America, no matter the medium. The zombie subgenre is nearly as popular in novels and films as it is in video games.", "headline": {"main": "Putting the Guilt Back in Killing", "kicker": "VIDEO GAME REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d8950a0", "word_count": 896, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/09dead/09dead-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/09dead/09dead-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/09dead/09dead-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/arts/09dead/09dead-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Video Games", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE WALKING DEAD (VIDEO GAME)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "WALKING DEAD, THE (VIDEO GAME)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE WALKING DEAD (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
