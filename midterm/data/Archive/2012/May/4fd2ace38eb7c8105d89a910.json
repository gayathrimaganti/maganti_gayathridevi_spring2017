The House Budget Committee on Monday took up budget bills passed out of six different committees last month, packaged them and sent them to the full House as one bill on a party-line vote. A separate bill, also approved by the committee, would formally lift the threat of automatic Pentagon cuts next year.", "headline": {"main": "House Bill Offers Aid Cuts To Save Military Spending"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a910", "word_count": 878, "multimedia": [{"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/08/us/sub-CONGRESS/sub-CONGRESS-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/us/sub-CONGRESS/sub-CONGRESS-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "RYAN, PAUL D JR"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DEFENSE DEPARTMENT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "REPUBLICAN PARTY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD STAMPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICAID"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FEDERAL BUDGET (US)"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
