The data came a few days before crucial elections in France and Greece, and it is likely to prompt more intense calls for an easing of Europe's austerity drive. Unemployment in the 17 countries that belong to the euro zone rose to 10.9 percent in March from 10.8 percent in February, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. In March 2011, the rate was 9.9 percent, a number that illustrates the deterioration of the region's economy in the last year.", "headline": {"main": "Jobless Rate Reaches New High in Euro Zone"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a5d", "word_count": 931, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/business/global/03euecon-pic/03euecon-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/business/global/03euecon-pic/03euecon-pic-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 370, "url": "images/2012/05/03/business/global/03euecon-pic/03euecon-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/business/global/03euecon-pic/03euecon-pic-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 370, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Business Day / Global Business", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREECE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EUROPEAN UNION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EURO (CURRENCY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS (2010- )"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNEMPLOYMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
