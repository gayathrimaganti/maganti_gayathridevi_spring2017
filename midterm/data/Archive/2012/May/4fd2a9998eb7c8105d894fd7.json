Bruno, a former majority leader of the State Senate, was charged on Thursday with taking bribes and kickbacks in a fraud scheme during his long tenure in office, setting up another battle with federal prosecutors who won a conviction against him in 2009. The indictment, unsealed in Federal District Court in Albany, comes nearly six months after a federal appeals court vacated Mr. Bruno's previous conviction because of a ruling in a separate case by the United States Supreme Court that undermined the government's legal claims against Mr. Bruno, a Republican from Rensselaer County. But the appeals court said Mr. Bruno could be retried on different charges.", "headline": {"main": "New Bribery Charges Filed Against Ex-Senate Leader"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d894fd7", "word_count": 470, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/nyregion/BRUNO/BRUNO-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/nyregion/BRUNO/BRUNO-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/04/nyregion/BRUNO/BRUNO-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/nyregion/BRUNO/BRUNO-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BRUNO, JOSEPH L"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ABBRUZZESE, JARED E"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK STATE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATE LEGISLATURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COURTS AND THE JUDICIARY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BRIBERY AND KICKBACKS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
