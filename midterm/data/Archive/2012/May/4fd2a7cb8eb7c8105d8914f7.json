There's the rose garden, with its 1,000 varieties; the Shakespeare garden, with 80 plants mentioned in his works; and the Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, the oldest in any American public setting, with its pines and quince and great schools of overstuffed koi skimming the water's surface. And of course there are the flowering cherry trees, more than 200 of them in long promenades, Brooklyn's answer to the annual spectacle in Washington. The cherry blossoms can bring as many as 37,000 visitors to the garden on a weekend day in early spring. The institution is also home to a surprisingly large collection of buildings, including a little columned and gabled house that serves the Children's Garden; a noble McKim, Mead & White palace for administration; the blocky Steinhardt Conservatory, built with a heavy hand in the late 1980s; and the elegant, arching Palm House, walled and roofed in glass, a favorite site for borough brides.", "headline": {"main": "A Welcome Transparency", "kicker": "ARCHITECTURE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914f7", "word_count": 941, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/BOTANIC/BOTANIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/BOTANIC/BOTANIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/BOTANIC/BOTANIC-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/arts/BOTANIC/BOTANIC-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARCHITECTURE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
