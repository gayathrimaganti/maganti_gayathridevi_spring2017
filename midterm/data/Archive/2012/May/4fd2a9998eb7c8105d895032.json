It was the third and final night of ''doubles'' at Albertsons. This biweekly happening, during which the store issues coupons that double the value of manufacturers' coupons, is to dedicated coupon clippers what the full moon was to Druids. Yoder and Knight, who are Mormon and have nine children between them (Yoder: seven; Knight: two) had spent the day working on their blog and then taught a three-hour couponing class -- all without a drop of forbidden caffeine. Yet with the supermarket in sight, they grew visibly jazzed, like Vegas high rollers entering a casino. ''We'll have it all to ourselves, and we'll know all the cashiers,'' Knight said. Within minutes, Knight -- a part-time dental hygienist with glossy, nearly waist-length blond hair and enviable white teeth -- had discovered a sale on StarKist tuna fish. ''Oh, Cathy, the tuna's a dollar right now!'' she said, as she stood before a shelf containing shiny blue plastic pouches of chunk-light tuna. A bulging nylon binder, which she had seated like a toddler in the front of her cart, held six StarKist coupons for 50 cents off; paired with Albertsons coupons, they were worth a dollar each, the same price as the tuna. ''So it's free right now,'' she continued. ''And we haven't even blogged about it!''", "headline": {"main": "Honey, I Got a Year's Worth Of Tuna Fish", "kicker": "THE MONEY ISSUE"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895032", "word_count": 4130, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06couponers1/06couponers1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06couponers1/06couponers1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 375, "url": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06couponers1/06couponers1-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/magazine/06couponers1/06couponers1-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 375, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Magazine", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "EXTREME COUPONING (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "YODER, CATHY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KNIGHT, MONICA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "BOISE (IDAHO)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FABULESSLYFRUGAL.COM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SHOPPING AND RETAIL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COUPONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
