But then you compared notes with other guests and learned that some paid even less. It happens to even the best bargain hunters -- whether it is a hotel deal or airfare -- and it's not a good feeling. Now a growing number of travel sites are offering to track the price after you reserve and to refund you the difference. While at least one, Yapta.com, has long alerted travelers to price drops even after a ticket has been purchased, travelers still had to do the follow-up work, including calling the airline to request the refund. The newer sites do much of that for you.", "headline": {"main": "Getting Refunds if the Price Drops", "kicker": "PRACTICAL TRAVELER"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca6e", "word_count": 1162, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/travel/06PRACTICAL/06PRACTICAL-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/travel/06PRACTICAL/06PRACTICAL-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 471, "url": "images/2012/05/06/travel/06PRACTICAL/06PRACTICAL-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/travel/06PRACTICAL/06PRACTICAL-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 471, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Travel", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BUDGET TRAVEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESERVATIONS (AIRLINES, HOTELS, ETC.)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
