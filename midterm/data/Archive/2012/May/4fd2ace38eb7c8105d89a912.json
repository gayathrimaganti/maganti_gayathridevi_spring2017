''What shall I do? Where am I going to go?'' Answers never come in ''The Caretaker,'' Harold Pinter's classic 1960 play about the peculiar relations among a tramp and two brothers in a cluttered room in a dilapidated London house. But like many other unanswered questions in Pinter plays, the old man's plea takes on a weird, terrible urgency.
