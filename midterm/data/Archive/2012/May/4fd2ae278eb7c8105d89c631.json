Instead of Italy in the 1920s, the place of renewal is Jaipur, India, and the time is now. Its seven travelers are financially distressed men and women of retirement age lured by an invitation to ''outsource'' themselves for a stay at the newly opened Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur. Upon arrival, they discover a place that is far from the luxurious retreat ''for the elderly and beautiful'' that its advertising claims. But after much grumbling, most of them take it in stride and begin to flourish.", "headline": {"main": "Seven Tickets to India, Please, and Reservations for an Adventure", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c631", "word_count": 826, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/BESTALT/BESTALT-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/BESTALT/BESTALT-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/BESTALT/BESTALT-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/BESTALT/BESTALT-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DENCH, JUDI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MADDEN, JOHN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SMITH, MAGGIE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NIGHY, BILL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WILKINSON, TOM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
