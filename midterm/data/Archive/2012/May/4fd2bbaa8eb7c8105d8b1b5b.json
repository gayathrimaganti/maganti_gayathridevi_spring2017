Throughout the arraignment, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and the other four defendants refused to talk to, or even listen to, the judge. Several delayed the hearing by praying, and one shouted to the judge that guards at the prison might kill them. Another was brought to the court in restraints and later took off his shirt, before insisting that the full charges be read aloud, which lasted into the night.", "headline": {"main": "9/11 Defendants Were Protesting 'Unjust System' at Hearing, Their Lawyers Say"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b5b", "word_count": 1045, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "U.S.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MARTINS, MARK S"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ALI, ALI ABDUL AZIZ"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BIN AL-SHIBH, RAMZI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ATTASH, WALID MUHAMMAD SALIH BIN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MOHAMMED, KHALID SHAIKH"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE (CUBA)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DETAINEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SEPTEMBER 11 (2001)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MILITARY TRIBUNALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
