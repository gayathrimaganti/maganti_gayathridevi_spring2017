The playful exhibition ''Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language,'' opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, borrows Smithson's title and runs wild with his vision of words as materials. Organized by the MoMA painting and sculpture curator Laura Hoptman, with help from the curatorial assistant Eleonore Hugendubel, it assembles works by artists and artist's groups who make written and spoken communication intensely physical. Like most shows at MoMA these days, ''Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language'' comes with a series of performances.", "headline": {"main": "Building Blocks of Meaning, Retranslated", "kicker": "ART REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca36", "word_count": 1035, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ALPHABET_SPAN/04ALPHABET_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ALPHABET_SPAN/04ALPHABET_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ALPHABET_SPAN/04ALPHABET_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04ALPHABET_SPAN/04ALPHABET_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LANGUAGE AND LANGUAGES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TYPOGRAPHY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
