Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, talks about how essential it is to modernize the theatrical elements of opera. But few recent Met productions are bolder or fresher than Dexter's staging of this great Britten work. The performance benefited from the inspired conducting of David Robertson and from a strong cast headed by the baritone Nathan Gunn, taking on the title role for the first time at the Met. He has sung it to acclaim elsewhere, including the Lyric Opera of Chicago, in an arresting 2001 production by David McVicar.", "headline": {"main": "Sailor Fighting The Undertow Of Repression", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d89508c", "word_count": 750, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BILLY/07BILLY-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BILLY/07BILLY-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 351, "url": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BILLY/07BILLY-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/07/arts/07BILLY/07BILLY-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 351, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-06T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BILLY BUDD (OPERA)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROBERTSON, DAVID"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BRITTEN, BENJAMIN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DASZAK, JOHN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MORRIS, JAMES"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GUNN, NATHAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DEXTER, JOHN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "METROPOLITAN OPERA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OPERA"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
