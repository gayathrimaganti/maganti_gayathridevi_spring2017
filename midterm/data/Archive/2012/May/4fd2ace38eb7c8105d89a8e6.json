Adding to the confusion is the logo of the new place, which consists of an interstate highway sign with the numbers 516. Rick Gusmano, who owns Americana along with his wife, Gin, said on the telephone after my visits that the couple had hoped to keep and build on the following of the earlier restaurant when they selected the name for theirs.", "headline": {"main": "A Familiar Location, But New Ambitions", "kicker": "LONG ISLAND DINING | SYOSSET"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a8e6", "word_count": 847, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINELI3/06DINELI3-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINELI3/06DINELI3-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINELI1_SPAN/06DINELI1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/nyregion/06DINELI1_SPAN/06DINELI1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "SYOSSET (NY)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICANA KITCHEN AND BAR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
