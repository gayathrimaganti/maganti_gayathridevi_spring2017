In particular, he studies -- and tries to raise public awareness about -- the rapid depletion of water supplies caused by agricultural overuse, rampant development and global climate change. His analyses are thorough and clear, and he presents them, at public meetings and straight to Ms. Yu's camera, with good-natured patience. For the most part, that is. At one point, contemplating a future of unchecked consumption and political paralysis, he sums it all up in blunt layman's terms: ''We're screwed.'' That might serve as an alternative name for Ms. Yu's film, or even for the genre to which it belongs. The global-catastrophe documentary is a thriving form these days, as the apparent unsustainability of human life has emerged as fertile ground for cinematic journalism. ''Last Call at the Oasis'' follows ''Payback,''''Surviving Progress'' and ''The Island President'' -- to name only some of the most recent releases -- in a drumbeat of elemental doom. The food we eat, the stuff we buy, the air we breathe, the fuel we burn, the water we drink: it's all killing us!", "headline": {"main": "When There Really Is Not a Drop to Drink", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b172f", "word_count": 772, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LAST1_SPAN/04LAST1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LAST1_SPAN/04LAST1_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LAST1_SPAN/04LAST1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04LAST1_SPAN/04LAST1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "LAST CALL AT THE OASIS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "YU, JESSICA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
