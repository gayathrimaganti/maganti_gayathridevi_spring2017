At the time, the company also made a replica of one of the pyramids, which each consisted of 11 stacked vases. That replica, left, was a jumping-off point for four designers -- Hella Jongerius, Studio Makkink & Bey, Studio Job and Alexander van Slobbe -- to reinterpret the 17th-century pyramid. The first exhibition devoted solely to those designs, ''Pyramids of Makkum,'' opens May 10 at Gallery Libby Sellers in London. ''In a shop, if you buy flowers, they're always in buckets, and these buckets are the new vases,'' said Jurgen Bey of the pyramid he created with Studio Makkink, below left, which is essentially four buckets balanced on top of one another. ''They all fit into each other, but you have to do it very carefully.''", "headline": {"main": "An Artful Tower of Flowers", "kicker": "CURRENTS | SHOWS"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d89141b", "word_count": 176, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/garden/03SHOWS1/03SHOWS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/garden/03SHOWS1/03SHOWS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Home & Garden", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ROYAL TICHELAAR MAKKUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FLOWERS AND PLANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CERAMICS AND POTTERY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
