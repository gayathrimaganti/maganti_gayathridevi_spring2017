Implicit almost throughout Susan Froemke's documentary film of that name -- when it is not explicit -- is the notion that Wagner, frustrated with limited 19th-century staging techniques, could have only dreamed of something like the high-tech machine that Robert Lepage has used to stage the ''Ring of the Nibelungen'' at the Metropolitan Opera. ''When you look at this,'' Georges Nicholson, identified as a Wagner historian, said, watching an early stage of the machine's construction, ''you feel like this is finally the 'Ring' that Wagner would have wanted all along.''", "headline": {"main": "Tale of the Met's 45-Ton Diva", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a915", "word_count": 571, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/RING-JP/RING-JP-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/arts/RING-JP/RING-JP-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 350, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/RING-JP/RING-JP-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/arts/RING-JP/RING-JP-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 350, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "DER RING DES NIEBELUNGEN (OPERA)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "WAGNER'S DREAM (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WAGNER, RICHARD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FROEMKE, SUSAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "METROPOLITAN OPERA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OPERA"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
