Salaita is the Palestinian-American professor and scholar whose offer of a tenured teaching position in the American Indian Studies Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was rescinded by the school\u2019s chancellor because of some very strongly worded tweets he published regarding Israel\u2019s attack on Gaza this summer. That attack followed a series of events that had heightened tension between the Israeli government and Hamas, the de facto ruling party in Gaza, culminating in Hamas\u2019s launching rockets into Israel and then Israel\u2019s mounting a huge aerial assault and ground invasion against Gaza. On September 11 of this year, the university\u2019s board of trustees voted to uphold the chancellor\u2019s decision.", "headline": {"main": "Did Salaita Cross the Line of \u2018Civility\u2019?", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "_id": "548e24e238f0d8437a5db88b", "word_count": "1563", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2014-12-14T19:00:25Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Civilian Casualties", "name": "subject", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Discrimination", "name": "subject", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Jews and Judaism", "name": "subject", "rank": "4"}, {"value": "Palestinians", "name": "subject", "rank": "5"}, {"value": "Philosophy", "name": "subject", "rank": "6"}, {"value": "Gaza Strip", "name": "glocations", "rank": "7"}, {"value": "Israel", "name": "glocations", "rank": "8"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
