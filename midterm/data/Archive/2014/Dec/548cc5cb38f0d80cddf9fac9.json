Add a letter, syllable or phrase to a word or phrase that exists and see if it makes another real word or phrase. If you can do the same thing a few more times, you\u2019ve got yourself a theme set. Now all you have to do is set it in a grid, fill it with lively and familiar entries without getting yourself stuck anywhere and then write a mass of brilliant clues that have no possibility of being wrong or offending anyone.
