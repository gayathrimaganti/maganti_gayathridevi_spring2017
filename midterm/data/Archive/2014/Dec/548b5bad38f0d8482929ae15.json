Tonight, Chandelier throws a celebration dedicated to another object of worship (for a certain kind of die-hard fan, anyway): Dolly Parton, who will be honored in various ways throughout the evening, from tribute performances by artists including Rufus Wainwright and Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters, to an exhibition of the Iron Butterfly\u2019s costumes. The agency also tapped the young director Nathaniel Brown to create a trippy datamoshed video, set to\u00a0a remix of \u201cJolene\u201d by the buzzy Norwegian producer Todd Terje. An exclusive preview \u2014 featuring kaleidoscopic visuals, a cameo by Paul Reubens and lots and lots of sequins \u2014 premieres here. A silent auction at Gavel & Grand, now live online, accompanies the exhibition; proceeds will benefit Dolly Parton\u2019s Imagination Library.", "headline": {"main": "A Trippy Tribute to Dolly Parton, Soundtracked by Todd Terje", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "548b5bad38f0d8482929ae15", "word_count": "151", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2014-12-12T16:15:24Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Parton, Dolly", "name": "persons", "rank": "2"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
