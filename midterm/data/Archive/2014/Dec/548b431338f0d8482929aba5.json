Schulz belong in the same breath as two of the most significant comics artists of the 20th century. Both were veterans of World War II and shared as heroes cartoonists like Milton Caniff (\u201cTerry and the Pirates\u201d), Alex Raymond (\u201cFlash Gordon\u201d) and Hal Foster (\u201cPrince Valiant\u201d). And upon their deaths, both left behind a trove of characters that continue to resonate and thrive. To name just a few: Captain America, the Mighty Thor, the Incredible Hulk (Kirby); Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus and Lucy (Schulz).", "headline": {"main": "A Fresh Look at Schulz and Kirby", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "548b431338f0d8482929aba5", "word_count": "670", "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2014-12-12T14:27:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}, {"value": "Kirby, Jack", "name": "persons", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "Schulz, Charles M", "name": "persons", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Books and Literature", "name": "subject", "rank": "4"}, {"value": "Comic Books and Strips", "name": "subject", "rank": "5"}, {"value": "The Art of the Simon and Kirby Studio (Book)", "name": "unknown", "rank": "6"}, {"value": "The Complete Peanuts: 1993 to 1994 (Book)", "name": "unknown", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
