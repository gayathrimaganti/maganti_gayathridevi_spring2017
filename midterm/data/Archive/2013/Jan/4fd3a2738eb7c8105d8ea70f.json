The cause of the injury has not been made public, but surgeons operated on Mr. Kiedis's right foot to remove a crushed sesamoid bone - a small bone in the ball of the foot at the base of the big toe -- and to reattach a flexor tendon, the statement said. The 49-year-old front man is expected to recover fully.", "headline": {"main": "Red Hot Chili Peppers Delay Tour After  Kiedis Has Surgery", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2738eb7c8105d8ea70f", "word_count": 172, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-11T14:02:23Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Tampa (Fla)", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "Florida", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
