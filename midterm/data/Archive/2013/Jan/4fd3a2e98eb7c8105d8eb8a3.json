A man and a woman - he a political activist, she a radio reporter - videotaped themselves entering an auditorium they say is located in Moscow's State University of Transportation. It is a weekend day during winter break, and the room is full. About 50 young people - presumably students at the university, though this is never made clear - are seated at desks, with stacks of papers in front of them. Hundreds of completed forms sit on a long desk at the front of the auditorium. During the nearly seven minutes that the recording lasts, the man and woman keep asking: \"What are you doing?\" They never get an answer and in the end are forcibly removed from the premises.", "headline": {"main": "The Kremlin's Stooges", "kicker": "Latitude"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e98eb7c8105d8eb8a3", "word_count": 688, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-11T04:24:46Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Elections", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Russia", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Putin, Vladimir V", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Video Recordings and Downloads", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
