Paired with all of these pretty, work-ready clothes are accessories that look just as beautiful and uncomplicated, like glossy slip-in ankle boots and slipper-front pumps - and there's a new bag, Lucy, a slim three-pocket with zipper closures that comes in multiple colorways and fabrics, with leather handles or a chain strap. The check version of the bag is shown here with cropped pants, a brushed wool plaid coat and this editor's favorite new flat: an emerald green loafer embellished with metal-tipped fringe.", "headline": {"main": "Just One Look | Chlo\u00e9", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e28eb7c8105d8eb64e", "word_count": 107, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-10T11:15:14Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Chloe", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
