It is both elegant and utterly simple: two curved pieces of molded plywood are held together through compression and tension by a single brass rod. The stool's graceful shape recalls a butterfly's wings, and has also been compared to the form of torii, the traditional Shinto shrine gates. According to Matilda McQuaid, the deputy curatorial director at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the stool \"epitomizes Yanagi's approach to design. He loved traditional Japanese crafts and was dedicated to the modernist principles of simplicity, practicality and tactility that are associated with Alvar Aalto, Charles and Ray Eames, and Le Corbusier.\"", "headline": {"main": "Seeing Things | Sori Yanagi's Everyday Beauty", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2eb8eb7c8105d8eb914", "word_count": 450, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-05T11:30:23Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
