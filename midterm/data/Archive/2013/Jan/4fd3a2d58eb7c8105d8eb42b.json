I'm here to tell you these are working feet,\" says Park Avenue's go-to podiatrist, Suzanne Levine, after a quick examination of my not-so-pretty pieds. In all fairness, my childhood and adolescence were spent studying ballet. Anyone who's worn a pair of pointe shoes will confirm that dancing in them is a kind of quiet torture that ceases to bother only after you've grown numb to the pain. Your feet never really recover from the trauma. I sought out Levine and a few other foot gurus after determining spring's must-have shoes: the bejeweled slip-ons from Oscar de la Renta, the velvet clogs from Miu Miu and the heel-less metallic numbers with super-pointy toes from Louis Vuitton, among others. The problem? All of these options are of the 18th-century mule variety. In other words, they leave your heels fully exposed, and mine, still callused and battered to a point seemingly beyond return, were in no position to be naked.", "headline": {"main": "Vain Glorious | The Happy Heel", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a2d58eb7c8105d8eb42b", "word_count": 638, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-05T18:00:16Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
