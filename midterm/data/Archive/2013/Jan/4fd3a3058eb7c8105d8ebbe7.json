This week, two more collected editions join the lists. On the hardcover list, the second omnibus of the series, which reprints issues 24 through 48 of the series, written by Robert Kirkman and illustrated by Charlie Adlard, arrives at No. 4. On the paperback list, vol. 15, which reprints issues 85 through 90, lands at the top spot. It's in good company, with a compendium edition including the first 48 issues at No. 2, and vol. 1, which contains the first six issues, at No. 9.", "headline": {"main": "Graphic Books Best Sellers: Zombies Continue Their Reign", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a3058eb7c8105d8ebbe7", "word_count": 399, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-06T13:02:54Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Graphic Novels", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kirkman, Robert", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Walking Dead, The (Book)", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
