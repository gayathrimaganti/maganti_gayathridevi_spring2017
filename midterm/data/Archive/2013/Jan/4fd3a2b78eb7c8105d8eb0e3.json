I don't know why the restaurant didn't make it on to more of those year's best lists that everybody was publishing last month (Breaking: Gael Greene just placed it on hers), because the place offers some of the most original Asian cooking that New York has seen recently. Along with RedFarm, Kin Shop and Rouge et Blanc, Wong makes a compelling case that Asian fusion and pan-Asian cuisine are alive and kicking, even though those terms feel extremely last century at the moment.", "headline": {"main": "Five Dishes at Wong", "kicker": "Diner's Journal"}, "_id": "4fd3a2b78eb7c8105d8eb0e3", "word_count": 955, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-03T16:02:23Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
