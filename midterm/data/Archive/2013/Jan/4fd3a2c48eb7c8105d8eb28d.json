So much so that the theater, unusually, decided to present \"Desh\" - a work in which Mr. Khan explores the confluence of his Bangladeshi origins with his British upbringing - again this season, in February. But Mr. Khan has had to cancel these coming performances, as well as a run of \"Sacred Monsters,\" with Sylvie Guillem, in France this week, because of an injured Achilles tendon, which is likely to keep him offstage for several months. Sadler's Wells plans to schedule a replacement run of \"Desh\" in October.", "headline": {"main": "Akram Khan Cancels Show Due to Injury", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c48eb7c8105d8eb28d", "word_count": 114, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-05T10:31:01Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Great Britain", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Sadler's Wells", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Khan, Akram", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
