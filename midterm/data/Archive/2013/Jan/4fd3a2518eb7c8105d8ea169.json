The Cardinal did not trail until the final whistle, had six different 7-point leads in the game, had the ball for 70 percent of the clock and outgained the Cowboys by 178 total yards, including a 243-13 advantage on the ground. Yet still Stanford could not come away with the win.", "headline": {"main": "In Stanford Loss, Echoes of Elway", "kicker": "The Quad"}, "_id": "4fd3a2518eb7c8105d8ea169", "word_count": 709, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-01-04T12:41:43Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Shaw, David", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Stanford University", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Luck, Andrew", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Elway, John", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Bowl Games", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Draft and Recruitment (Sports)", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fiesta Bowl", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Football", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Oklahoma State University", "rank": "9"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
