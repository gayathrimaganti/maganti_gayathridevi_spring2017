The broadcaster, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, sought to distance itself from Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation conglomerate and, invoking the standard held by British regulators currently weighing the channel's broadcast future, insisted that it was itself a ''fit and proper'' company to hold a broadcasting license. Last year News Corporation abandoned a $12 billion bid to assume full control of BSkyB when its British newspaper subsidiary, News International, a separate company, became mired in the phone hacking scandal that continues to spread through Mr. Murdoch's empire, while also enmeshing some of Britain's top politicians and law-enforcement officials.", "headline": {"main": "Broadcaster Distances Itself From News Corp."}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a66", "word_count": 790, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/global-home/3sky-image/3sky-image-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/global-home/3sky-image/3sky-image-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MURDOCH, RUPERT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "GREAT BRITAIN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEWS CORPORATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BRITISH SKY BROADCASTING GROUP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LEGISLATURES AND PARLIAMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
