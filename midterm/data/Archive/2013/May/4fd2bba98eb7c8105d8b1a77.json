Yet somehow the intense, insightful German baritone Matthias Goerne and the brilliant Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes made the prospect of morbid soul searching not only inviting, but also deeply stimulating. On record, at least, Mr. Goerne has been much concerned with the songs of Schubert, spinning out a half-dozen eloquent discs on the Harmonia Mundi label over the last four years. But at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday, he and Mr. Andsnes presented a program they have been touring together: songs from Mahler's cycles ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn,'' ''R\u00fcckert-Lieder'' and ''Kindertotenlieder,'' interspersed with selections from Shostakovich's ''Michelangelo Suite.''", "headline": {"main": "Considering Life's End And What Comes After", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a77", "word_count": 451, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/MATTHIAS/MATTHIAS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/arts/MATTHIAS/MATTHIAS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ANDSNES, LEIF OVE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOERNE, MATTHIAS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CARNEGIE HALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CLASSICAL MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
