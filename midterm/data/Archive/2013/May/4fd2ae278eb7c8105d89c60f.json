Around 6:15 a.m., attackers wearing suicide vests drove a car packed with explosives up to the main gate of the compound, called the Green Village. A heavily secured campus of about four acres, hedged by razor-wire-tipped walls, it houses the residences of American military contractors and Defense Department civilian employees as well as some European diplomats, United Nations employees and other foreign workers. It is in a neighborhood of NATO bases and contractor compounds.", "headline": {"main": "Hours After Obama's Visit, Suicide Attackers Kill at Least 8 in Afghanistan"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c60f", "word_count": 876, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/world/afghanistan/afghanistan-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/world/afghanistan/afghanistan-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/03/world/afghanistan/afghanistan-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/world/afghanistan/afghanistan-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Asia Pacific", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "KABUL (AFGHANISTAN)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AFGHANISTAN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AFGHANISTAN WAR (2001- )"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
