It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But the genre, though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy, has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence. (Do you really want to have an argument about this? If so, put on your best oversize metal suit and wait for me at the top of the New York Times building. I'll be there as soon as I finish beta-testing my death ray. Apologies in advance to any commuters crushed by flying debris.) The latest evidence -- though it is unlikely to be the last, with a new ''Spider-Man'' and another ''Dark Knight'' looming on the horizon -- is ''Marvel's The Avengers.'' You may occasionally encounter (as I have, a few times in the past months) a walking relic of an earlier era of pop-cultural fandom who wonders if they have, at last, made another movie out of that fondly recalled British spy series from the 1960s. ''They'' have not, and those poor souls who cherish old daydreams of Diana Rigg in leather will have to console themselves with images of Scarlett Johansson in a black bodysuit.", "headline": {"main": "Superheroes, Super Battles, Super Egos", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a8a", "word_count": 1164, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/movies/avengers-span/avengers-span-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/movies/avengers-span/avengers-span-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 346, "url": "images/2012/05/02/movies/avengers-span/avengers-span-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/movies/avengers-span/avengers-span-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 346, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE AVENGERS (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RENNER, JEREMY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "JOHANSSON, SCARLETT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "EVANS, CHRIS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RUFFALO, MARK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WHEDON, JOSS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "JACKSON, SAMUEL L"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HIDDLESTON, TOM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DOWNEY, ROBERT JR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
