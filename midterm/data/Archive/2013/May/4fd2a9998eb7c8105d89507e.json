Mr. Hollande's victory has presented the French center-right with its most painful dilemma in a generation, particularly following the strong showing of the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in first-round voting. President Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement must now decide whether it makes a deal with Ms. Le Pen's National Front to try to limit a Socialist landslide, or reject its extremist positions to preserve the soul of the party, at the risk of weakening its own ranks.", "headline": {"main": "After Sarkozy's Loss, France's Center-Right Party Is Facing Unpalatable Options"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d89507e", "word_count": 1292, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 370, "url": "images/2012/05/08/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/world/FRANCE/FRANCE-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 370, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Europe", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SARKOZY, NICOLAS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HOLLANDE, FRANCOIS"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL FRONT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "UNION FOR A POPULAR MOVEMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
