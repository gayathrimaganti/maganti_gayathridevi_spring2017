Congress decided 25 years ago that the Department of Energy should build a repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, a volcanic ridge in Nevada 100 miles from Las Vegas, if the regulatory commission determined the site to be suitable. But the commission decided last year to end its consideration, with the chairman, Gregory B. Jaczko, pointing out that Congress was no longer providing money to advance the project.", "headline": {"main": "Court Urged To Force U.S. To Evaluate Nuclear Site"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca32", "word_count": 467, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Science / Environment", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "YUCCA MOUNTAIN (NEV)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WASHINGTON (STATE)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SOUTH CAROLINA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NUCLEAR WASTES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NUCLEAR ENERGY"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
