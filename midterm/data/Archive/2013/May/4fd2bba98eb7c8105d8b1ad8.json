The market had indeed skidded by then -- but not anywhere near as much as it was about to. ''I made what I thought was a reasonably low offer, but clearly we had not hit the bottom yet.''", "headline": {"main": "Partly Sunny at the Shore", "kicker": "IN THE REGION | NEW JERSEY"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1ad8", "word_count": 1035, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06NJZONE_SPAN/06NJZONE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06NJZONE_SPAN/06NJZONE_SPAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06NJZONE_SPAN/06NJZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/realestate/06NJZONE_SPAN/06NJZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Real Estate", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW JERSEY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REAL ESTATE AND HOUSING (RESIDENTIAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
