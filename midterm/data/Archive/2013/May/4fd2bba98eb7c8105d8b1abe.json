At least four demonstrators were said to be killed.

A turn in Aleppo, the country's commercial capital, could present new complications for Mr. Assad, who has deftly maneuvered to stay in power throughout the uprising.", "headline": {"main": "Aleppo Clash Poses Risk Of Widening Syrian Revolt"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1abe", "word_count": 638, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "World / Middle East", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ASSAD, BASHAR AL-"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ANNAN, KOFI"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ALEPPO (SYRIA)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SYRIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ALEPPO UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SHUTDOWNS (INSTITUTIONAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA UNREST (2010- )"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEMONSTRATIONS, PROTESTS, AND RIOTS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
