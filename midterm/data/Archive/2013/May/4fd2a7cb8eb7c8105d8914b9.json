He met another boy who became his first rival. This is how Phil Mickelson punched his ticket to the World Golf Hall of Fame, through a lifetime of identifying targets and taking aim at them as if they were flags on the practice range. Mickelson, 41, who will be inducted into the Hall on Monday in St. Augustine, Fla., first crossed paths with Harry Rudolph III at Presidio Hills Golf Course when they were 6. Over the next decade, they became the two best junior golfers in the country while playing practice matches for tees and competitive rounds for hometown bragging rights.", "headline": {"main": "Playing for Tees, and $5"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914b9", "word_count": 1170, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-mickelson-1/dog-mickelson-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-mickelson-1/dog-mickelson-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Golf", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "RUDOLPH, HARRY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ZERMAN, MANNY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MICKELSON, PHIL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORLD GOLF HALL OF FAME"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PGA CHAMPIONSHIP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GOLF"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
