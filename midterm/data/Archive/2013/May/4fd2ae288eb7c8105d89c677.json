At the White House Correspondents' Association dinner last month, President Obama playfully referenced a passage in his memoir in which he told of eating dog meat as a child in Indonesia. Riffing on Sarah Palin's line -- and responding to Republican criticism -- he said, ''What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.'' (Of course, Republicans have had their own canine issues, given Mitt Romney's predilection for fastening his Irish setter to the top of the family car in the 1980s.) Although dog-eating is taboo in the United States, personal consumption of dog meat is legal in most states. Likewise, Americans find horse-eating offensive; a five-year federal ban on slaughtering horses for human consumption was lifted last year. (Chicken-fried horse steak with onion gravy was on the menu at the Harvard Faculty Club until 1985.) Horse meat is consumed in France, just as dog meat is eaten in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tonga, parts of Asia and even Switzerland. In Poland, some ingest dog fat as a curative. The status of dog meat as a hard-luck food is also well documented -- Germans during the two world wars referred to it as ''blockade mutton.''", "headline": {"main": "The Dog Ate My Birth Certificate", "kicker": "OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR"}, "_id": "4fd2ae288eb7c8105d89c677", "word_count": 732, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NATIVE AMERICANS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOGS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FILIPINO-AMERICANS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CRUELTY TO ANIMALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Op-Ed"}
