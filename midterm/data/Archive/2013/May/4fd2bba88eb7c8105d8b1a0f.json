Mr. Eno's voice, which teases out the poetry in the pedestrian and finds glinting humor in the static that infuses our faltering efforts to communicate, is as distinctive as any American playwright's today. He writes about big matters -- nothing bigger than life and death, after all -- as if they were incidental oddities deserving of wry comment but no great moralizing or posturing. ''The Realistic Joneses,'' directed with grace by the busy Sam Gold, is dappled with the quirky non sequiturs and deadpan wordplay that are among Mr. Eno's signature effects, along with a quiet insistence on the majesty and mystery of human existence. As delivered by an ideal cast -- Johanna Day, Glenn Fitzgerald, Tracy Letts and Parker Posey, all keenly attuned to Mr. Eno's sensibility -- his off-kilter dialogue comes to seem as natural, and lovely, as the chirping of crickets and the sound of bird song.", "headline": {"main": "Casual Joy And Dread, Mingling Every Day", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bba88eb7c8105d8b1a0f", "word_count": 1087, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/arts/REALISTIC/REALISTIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/arts/REALISTIC/REALISTIC-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 389, "url": "images/2012/05/02/arts/REALISTIC/REALISTIC-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/arts/REALISTIC/REALISTIC-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 389, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "THE REALISTIC JONESES (PLAY)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "REALISTIC JONESES, THE (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DAY, JOHANNA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLD, SAM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FITZGERALD, GLENN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LETTS, TRACY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "POSEY, PARKER"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ENO, WILL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YALE REPERTORY THEATER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
