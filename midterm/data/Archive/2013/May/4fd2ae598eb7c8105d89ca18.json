The father, Thomas Sullivan Sr., 49, a police captain in Larchmont, N.Y., did not get out of the burning house in time. He stayed back in the two-story residence where his wife, Donna, 48, and daughters Meaghan, 18 and Mairead, 13, remained in their bedrooms.", "headline": {"main": "Fire Kills Police Captain, His Wife and Two Daughters"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca18", "word_count": 585, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/FIRE/FIRE-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/nyregion/FIRE/FIRE-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SULLIVAN, THOMAS JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SULLIVAN, THOMAS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SULLIVAN, MEAGHAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SULLIVAN, MAIREAD"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SULLIVAN, DONNA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "PUTNAM COUNTY (NY)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "CARMEL (NY)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "LARCHMONT (NY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DEATHS (FATALITIES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FIRES AND FIREFIGHTERS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
