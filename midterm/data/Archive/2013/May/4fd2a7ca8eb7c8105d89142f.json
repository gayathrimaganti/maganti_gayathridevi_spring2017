You and I do not turn out our legs to 180 degrees; you and I do not dance on point. In the stage worlds of his ballets, however, these things become the premise through which music and drama become keener and more intense. Watching, we find our senses changed. The fusion of music and womanhood and academicism is heady stuff. On Tuesday night, City Ballet's spring season began with Balanchine's ''Serenade'' (1934). The curtain rose on the very peculiar and entirely haunting ritual in which 17 women stand on flat feet and all in unison, following the seemingly secret dictates of the music, work their way through a series of upper-body gestures that develop inexorably into the lower-body rigor of ballet.", "headline": {"main": "Balanchine's Gift for Joining What Nature Has Sundered", "kicker": "DANCE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d89142f", "word_count": 1010, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/NYCB-JP/NYCB-JP-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/arts/NYCB-JP/NYCB-JP-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/NYCB-JP/NYCB-JP-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/arts/NYCB-JP/NYCB-JP-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BALANCHINE, GEORGE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY BALLET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
