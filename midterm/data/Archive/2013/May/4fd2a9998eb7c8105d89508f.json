At any time of the day you can see variations of her stage character clacking noisily along Manhattan sidewalks, oblivious to her surroundings, a cellphone glued to her ear. If she's pushing a stroller, you'd better get out of the way. At last week's opening-night performance of her saucy new show, ''NY I Love You,'' in the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle, Ms. Bergl strutted to the stage in white tie and tails and fishnet stockings. Her insinuating gaze flashed the mischief and challenge of a woman signaling that she might be too hot to handle. That image was matched be her sassy, tough-cookie voice, a theatrically savvy variation on the assertive whine of today's one-name pop divas. She was accompanied by a quartet led by her pianist, Jonathan Mastro.", "headline": {"main": "Tough Cookie Takes Manhattan", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d89508f", "word_count": 442, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/emily/emily-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/arts/emily/emily-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BERGL, EMILY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CAFE CARLYLE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
