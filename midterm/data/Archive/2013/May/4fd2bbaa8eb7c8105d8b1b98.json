The same article praised four other places to eat, including Gaston, on East 49th Street, which ''may qualify as having one of the most inspired French kitchens in town,'' and Marchi's, on East 31st Street, ''one of New York's most unusual North Italian restaurants.'' The author of these judgments was Craig Claiborne, the newspaper's food editor. He prefaced his article with a short note: ''The following is a listing of New York restaurants that are recommended on the basis of varying merits. Such a listing will be published every Friday in The New York Times.''", "headline": {"main": "When He Dined, the Stars Came Out", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b98", "word_count": 1749, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09CLAIBORNE2/09CLAIBORNE2-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09CLAIBORNE2/09CLAIBORNE2-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09CLAIBORNE3_SPAN/09CLAIBORNE2c-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/dining/09CLAIBORNE3_SPAN/09CLAIBORNE2c-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Dining & Wine", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLAIBORNE, CRAIG"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK TIMES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEWSPAPERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WRITING AND WRITERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis"}
