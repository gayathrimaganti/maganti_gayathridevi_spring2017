The backdrop of most of their memories and nightmares is the Lodz ghetto, which outlasted all of Poland's other Jewish ghettos by becoming an industrial complex for the Nazi army. Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski, the Nazi-appointed, dictatorial Jewish leader of the ghetto, plays a prominent role in the family history as well. All this makes for a promising (if well-plumbed) premise for theatrical exploration. Unfortunately, the execution suffers. The characters are underwritten; the symbolism is overwrought; the performers overact; and the direction (by Ronald Cohen) is seriously underachieving.", "headline": {"main": "Confronting Evil: 3 Generations Gripped by the Holocaust", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a99a8eb7c8105d8950c9", "word_count": 304, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/eaves/eaves-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/eaves/eaves-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "EAVESDROPPING ON DREAMS (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BEKERMAN-GREENBERG, RIVKA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "COHEN, RONALD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BAREFOOT THEATER CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
