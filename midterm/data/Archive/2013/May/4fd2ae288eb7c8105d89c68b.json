The grilled lobsters were tempting to be sure, but a highlight was fish boldly baked Moroccan-style, with spices, herbs, tomatoes and olives. I left Morocco a few weeks ago with the recipe in my notebook and thought of it for our Greek reds. Though the wines could accept a broad range of dishes, one might detect a Greek accent in the fish dish, with its garlic, lemon, parsley, peppers, tomatoes, olives and olive oil. It's an easy all-in-one recipe that can be served at room temperature. Double or triple it and you have the anchor for a summer party menu, even on a buffet that is less copious than the one in Marrakesh. Cool some Greek reds to pour alongside.
