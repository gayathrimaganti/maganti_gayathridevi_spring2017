Bright lines emerge out of nowhere on the wall behind them, lengthening in free curves that spill over, surprisingly, onto the plane of the floor. Only when the lines are suddenly switched off does it become clear that they are made of light. In this production, the entire stage -- as well as the four dancers, who frequently enter and exit it -- serves as an Etch A Sketch for the projected doodles of someone in the audience. (It is the visual artist Anna Schuleit, never seen.) On Wednesday the doodler dramatically scribbled over the prostrate form of Eleanor Smith, maybe to highlight her, maybe to cross her out. Generally, though, the doodler was inactive for long periods, either engrossed or not paying attention.", "headline": {"main": "Performers to Fulfill a Doodler's Dream", "kicker": "DANCE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1ab1", "word_count": 552, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/BALDWIN/BALDWIN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/05/arts/BALDWIN/BALDWIN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/05/arts/BALDWIN/BALDWIN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/05/arts/BALDWIN/BALDWIN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BALDWIN, IVY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK LIVE ARTS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BALDWIN, IVY, DANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
