It was 36 years old, and was drowned by big money and starved by the disdain of politicians who should have known better. From 1976 until 2008, every major-party presidential candidate took public money for the general election, adhering to spending limits that significantly reduced the influence of money on American elections. Candidates began dropping out of public financing for primaries in 2000, and then in 2008, Barack Obama abandoned the system entirely, preferring to raise more money from small donations, and promising to fix the public program. He has made almost no attempt to fulfill that promise.", "headline": {"main": "An Idea Worth Saving", "kicker": "EDITORIAL"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d89148e", "word_count": 945, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Opinion / Sunday Review", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "OBAMA, BARACK"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PRICE, DAVID EUGENE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "VAN HOLLEN, CHRISTOPHER JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ROMNEY, MITT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SENATE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2012"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CAMPAIGN FINANCE"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Editorial"}
