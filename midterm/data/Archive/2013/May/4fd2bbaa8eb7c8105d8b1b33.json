Now a group of investors has bought the assets of that famous punk-rock club, which closed in 2006, and plans to establish an ambitious music festival this summer, with an eye toward reopening the club at a new downtown location. The new owners of the club's assets -- some with ties to the original Bowery establishment -- say they hope that the festival will revive the wide-open artistic aesthetic associated with CBGB, which in its heyday served as an incubator for influential acts like Television, Talking Heads, the Ramones, Blondie, Sonic Youth and Patti Smith.", "headline": {"main": "CBGB Is Dead.
