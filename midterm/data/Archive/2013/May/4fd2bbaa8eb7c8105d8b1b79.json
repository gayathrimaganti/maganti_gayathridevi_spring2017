There's this comically nervous guy, afraid of his own shadow (for good reason -- he is brand-new in the witness protection program), dealing with his next-to-worst nightmare: a series of odd characters turning up, in rapid succession, at his front door. And he hasn't even finished installing the new locks. First there's Myrna (Cam Kornman in this Workshop Theater Company production), the wild-eyed older lady next door, who has brought a meat loaf supposedly made by her single daughter, Debra. Then there's Matt (Matt Walker), a new colleague who has followed our hero back from Home Depot -- and brought beer -- for no discernible reason. Then Debra (Dee Dee Friedman) shows up, carrying her omnipresent parasol (because SPF 50 isn't enough in the New Mexico sun), getting all obsessive-compulsive over dish washing and refusing to touch the doorknob.", "headline": {"main": "Dreading Visits From Friendly Neighbors", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b79", "word_count": 355, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/arts/SUB-PROTECTED/SUB-PROTECTED-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/arts/SUB-PROTECTED/SUB-PROTECTED-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "PROTECTED (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HARRIS, TIMOTHY SCOTT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "COTE, THOMAS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PAUL, JEFF"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WORKSHOP THEATER CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
