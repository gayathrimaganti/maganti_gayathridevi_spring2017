I ran it successfully -- if less than spectacularly -- in 2007, but I went over my five-hour goal by 15 minutes. I knew I would try again, and I know I'll need help staying motivated. Thankfully, for those seeking the support of a more social running experience, New York has many options. NEW YORK ROAD RUNNERSMore than 30 races are scheduled each year by the New York Road Runners. Most are in Central Park, but a few will have you in other parts of the city. The Wall Street Run (on May 31), which weaves through the financial district, and the borough half-marathons are favorites. The Brooklyn half, my first long run of the year, on May 19, is sold out, but races in Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island are still ahead. The Road Runners also have classes, from beginner to competitive, and the next wave of 10-week sessions begins on May 22. The $40 annual membership grants discounted fees for races and classes.", "headline": {"main": "Kick Up Those Heels", "kicker": "URBAN ATHLETE"}, "_id": "4fd2ae278eb7c8105d89c630", "word_count": 597, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04URBAN/04URBAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04URBAN/04URBAN-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04URBAN/04URBAN-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04URBAN/04URBAN-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "N.Y. / Region", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEW YORK CITY MARATHON"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RUNNING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
