In the opening moments of this ''Macbeth,'' directed by Ron Russell, a home video plays, showing a mother, father and infant. There's also a photo nearby of those parents, the Macbeths it turns out, gently kissing their baby's head. A painted version of that image forms a backdrop above the stage. The idea probably comes from Lady Macbeth's lines ''I have given suck, and know/How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me,'' words that have been much puzzled over and variously interpreted. Here Mr. Russell seems to want to suggest that the loss of a baby is what drives the Macbeths' vaulting ambition and bloody deeds.", "headline": {"main": "That Anguished Scottish Family: Toil, Trouble and Maybe Junior", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2bba98eb7c8105d8b1a9d", "word_count": 459, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04MACBETH/04MACBETH-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/04/arts/04MACBETH/04MACBETH-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "MACBETH (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RUSSELL, RON"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "JONES, TY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRIEDMAN, MELISSA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EPIC THEATER ENSEMBLE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
