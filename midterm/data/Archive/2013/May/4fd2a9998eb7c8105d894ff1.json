Granted, it begins with a short burst of brassy dissonance, and altered versions of that gesture return during the slow, dark-hued overture that pours forth before the angel Raphael's serene narration of the familiar scene from Genesis: the formlessness of the earth, the darkness on the face of the waters. And when a second angel, Uriel, announces the creation of light, Haydn provides a magnificent explosion of C major orchestral timbre. Yet the salient musical features of this depiction are graceful melody and tonal harmony. To experience it as the primordial chaos Haydn intended, you need to imagine hearing it with 18th-century ears.", "headline": {"main": "The Angels in the Heavens Sing for Themselves", "kicker": "MUSIC REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d894ff1", "word_count": 453, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "SUZUKI, MASAAKI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HAYDN, FRANZ JOSEPH"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YALE SCHOLA CANTORUM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ST.
