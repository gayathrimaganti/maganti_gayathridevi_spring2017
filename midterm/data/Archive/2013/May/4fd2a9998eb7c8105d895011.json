Why is that cop (Randeep Hooda) swigging whiskey and preparing to dangle a suspect off a bridge? Because, his partner soon explains, he has lost his wife and vowed revenge against the gun smugglers who killed her. And why does our hero, Sonu (the sad-eyed Emraan Hashmi), a small-time gun seller and ''cheeky rogue'' want to go straight? Because, he explains, he needs to live up to the ideals of the woman he loves, Jaanvi (Esha Gupta, a beauty queen making her wan film debut). She's the clinic doctor who patches him up after Mr. Hooda's cop slashes his hand.", "headline": {"main": "Bollywood Characters Pursuing Weapons While Fleeing the Deadliest One, the Past", "kicker": "MOVIE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2a9998eb7c8105d895011", "word_count": 404, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-04T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Movies", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "JANNAT 2 (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DESHMUKH, KUNAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOVIES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
