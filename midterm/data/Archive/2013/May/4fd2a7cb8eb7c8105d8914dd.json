Major League Baseball responded to Hamels's actions -- and perhaps his candid remarks, too -- with a five-game suspension and an undisclosed fine Monday. ''He could have been more discreet about it or a little less honest,'' Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel said before the Phillies' game Monday night against the Mets. ''Actually, the way I looked at that, baseball's going to take care of that. The way you take care of that is with the two teams on the field.''", "headline": {"main": "Phillies' Hamels Is Suspended For Five Games"}, "_id": "4fd2a7cb8eb7c8105d8914dd", "word_count": 568, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/sports/YHAMELS/YHAMELS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/sports/YHAMELS/YHAMELS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Baseball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "ZIMMERMANN, JORDAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HARPER, BRYCE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HAMELS, COLE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WASHINGTON NATIONALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BASEBALL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUSPENSIONS, DISMISSALS AND RESIGNATIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
