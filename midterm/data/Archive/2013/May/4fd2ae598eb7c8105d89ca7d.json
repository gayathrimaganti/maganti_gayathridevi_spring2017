''I am tir-ed, I am tir-ed,'' she chants in a sing-song, childlike rhythm. Round and round she goes until her chant is interrupted by gasps for breath, her steps falter, and her arm shakes with the effort of holding the fabric aloft. It's an emblematic passage in this dance, created in the year of its title and seen at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ville here on Friday night. It also symbolizes a vital element of all Bausch's work: the moment when representation becomes reality, when the ideas of the signifier and the signified collapse. That realism is an essential part of Bausch's power as a creator and it permeates her oeuvre down to the most seemingly minor occurrences. When, later in ''1980,'' water is squirted into the faces of a line of women onstage who appear to be taking part in some sort of competition, their reactions are instinctive, and we understand something of each personality through the subsequent scream, squeal or glare.", "headline": {"main": "The Madness That Is Part Of Every Life", "kicker": "DANCE REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ae598eb7c8105d89ca7d", "word_count": 676, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/BAUSCH/BAUSCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/08/arts/BAUSCH/BAUSCH-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/08/arts/BAUSCH/BAUSCH-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/08/arts/BAUSCH/BAUSCH-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-07T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Dance", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BAUSCH, PINA"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "PARIS (FRANCE)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DANCING"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
