The deal requires the company, Telcel, which controls about 70 percent of Mexico's wireless market, to stop giving its customers discounted rates for calls to other Telcel users, a policy that competitors say has made it hard to compete.", "headline": {"main": "Mexico Drops Big Fine in Settlement With Wireless Carrier"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d891435", "word_count": 508, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-05-03T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Business Day / Global Business", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "MEXICO"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TELCEL CELULAR"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICA MOVIL SAB DE CV"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINES (PENALTIES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTITRUST LAWS AND COMPETITION ISSUES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
