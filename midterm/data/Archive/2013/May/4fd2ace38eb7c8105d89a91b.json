Ostensibly a comic narrative about transcending childhood trauma, this stew, from the New York Neo-Futurists troupe, is really about nostalgia -- for Dungeons & Dragons, for innocent rap, for Space Invaders. Participating with relish are three ingratiating actors (Kevin R. Free, Marta Rainer and Adam Smith) playing versions of themselves. (They also wrote the slightly scattered script, with Eevin Hartsough.) The somewhat shy Adam dreams of having ''combustible hands'' shooting balls of fire; Marta, a frequent object of kickball torment, wears cardboard armor and fantasizes about joining an army of empowered \u00fcber-girls; Kevin wants to escape his basement and make something of himself.", "headline": {"main": "Compatriots in Geekery Recover From the Past", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a91b", "word_count": 315, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/09/theater/09youare-web/09youare-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/09/theater/09youare-web/09youare-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 378, "url": "images/2012/05/09/theater/09youare-web/09youare-web-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/09/theater/09youare-web/09youare-web-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 378, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Theater Reviews", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "YOU ARE IN AN OPEN FIELD (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SMITH, ADAM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RAINER, MARTA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FREE, KEVIN R"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HARTSOUGH, EEVIN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW YORK NEO-FUTURISTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Review"}
