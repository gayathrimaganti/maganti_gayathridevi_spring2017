He had just scored the decisive goal in Game 2 of their Eastern Conference semifinal Tuesday night against the Flyers, and at the other end of the ice Devils goalie Martin Brodeur figured Clarkson was milking the moment, posing for photographs. Zach Parise knew otherwise. He skated a few strides and told his pal, ''Get off the net so we can celebrate.'' The Devils' 4-1 victory offered cause for rejoicing in their locker room and for consternation inside the Flyers', where players lamented a lack of competitiveness and resolve. Over the final 40 minutes, the Devils outplayed, outskated and outhustled the Flyers, an effort rewarded by a four-goal outburst in the third period that evened their series heading into Game 3 on Thursday in Newark.", "headline": {"main": "Bullying Flyers, Devils Grab Win and Momentum", "kicker": "GAME 2: DEVILS 4, FLYERS 1"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b16e9", "word_count": 916, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 360, "url": "images/2012/05/02/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/02/sports/DEVILS/DEVILS-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 360, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / Hockey", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "PHILADELPHIA FLYERS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NEW JERSEY DEVILS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOCKEY, ICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PLAYOFF GAMES"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
