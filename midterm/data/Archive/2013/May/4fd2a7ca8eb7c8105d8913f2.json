The estates of George and Ira Gershwin also did well, with two musicals built on the brothers' song catalogs -- ''The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess'' and ''Nice Work if You Can Get It'' -- receiving 10 nominations each. Disney had its best performance since ''The Lion King'' in 1998. That company's new song-and-dance show, ''Newsies the Musical,'' received eight nominations, making it a leading contender against ''Once''; it also helped develop the top-nominated play ''Peter and the Starcatcher,'' a prequel to Peter Pan that received nine nominations.", "headline": {"main": "Tony Standouts Include 'Once' And 'Peter and the Starcatcher'"}, "_id": "4fd2a7ca8eb7c8105d8913f2", "word_count": 1423, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/02/arts/TONY2/TONY2-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/02/arts/TONY2/TONY2-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Theater / Tony Awards", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "ONCE (PLAY)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "GERSHWINS' PORGY AND BESS, THE (PLAY)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT (PLAY)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TONY AWARDS (THEATER AWARDS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
