Bidders could be heard speaking Chinese and English (and, some said, Norwegian), but the mystery winner bid over the phone, through Charles Moffett, Sotheby's executive vice president and vice chairman of its worldwide Impressionist, modern and contemporary art department. Gasps could be heard as the bidding climbed higher and higher, until there was a pause at $99 million, prompting Tobias Meyer, the evening's auctioneer, to smile and say, ''I have all the time in the world.'' When $100 million was bid, the audience began to applaud.", "headline": {"main": "'The Scream' Is Auctioned for a Record Price, $119.9 Million"}, "_id": "4fd2baa88eb7c8105d8b1710", "word_count": 1013, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/nyregion/AUCTION/AUCTION-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/nyregion/AUCTION/AUCTION-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 394, "url": "images/2012/05/03/nyregion/AUCTION/AUCTION-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/nyregion/AUCTION/AUCTION-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 394, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Art & Design", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MUNCH, EDVARD"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "MANHATTAN (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SOTHEBY'S"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AUCTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
