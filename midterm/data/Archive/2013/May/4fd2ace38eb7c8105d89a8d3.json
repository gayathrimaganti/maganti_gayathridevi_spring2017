He was a teenager, listening to the car radio in his hometown, Detroit, when he heard the title track of a 1966 album by Joe Henderson. ''I heard this saxophone playing, and it was riveting,'' he said recently. ''I didn't know anything about jazz. But this thing jumped out and grabbed me. It was 'Mode for Joe.' '' That spark of a relationship between listener and label bloomed into a steady flame for Mr. Was, who at 59 is the president of Blue Note, with a full plate of new developments to his credit. It's still early, but his energetic stewardship could be just what's needed at a time of corporate transition for the label, in a difficult industry climate.", "headline": {"main": "Exuberance Is Just One Of His Skills", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "_id": "4fd2ace38eb7c8105d89a8d3", "word_count": 1104, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/bluenote-1335985015171/bluenote-1335985015171-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/03/arts/bluenote-1335985015171/bluenote-1335985015171-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 375, "url": "images/2012/05/03/arts/bluenote-1335985015171/bluenote-1335985015171-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/03/arts/bluenote-1335985015171/bluenote-1335985015171-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 375, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-02T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Arts / Music", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WAS, DON"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BLUE NOTE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JAZZ"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "News"}
