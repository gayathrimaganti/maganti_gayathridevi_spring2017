That, of course, is recruiting jargon, a language Kline expertly speaks. Kline is the 17-year-old impresario behind TheRecruitScoop.com, which in three years of existence has established itself as a highly authoritative observer of the college basketball recruiting scene. His reliable reporting has earned him 21,000 followers on Twitter, and on Monday, his upstart site will enter a new phase. That is when Kline, still in high school, will officially become a partner with Rivals.com and Yahoo Sports and take himself and his site to a new level of exposure.", "headline": {"main": "A High School Senior Is Also a Keen Student of College Recruiting"}, "_id": "4fd2bbaa8eb7c8105d8b1b1b", "word_count": 1129, "multimedia": [{"height": 75, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-recruiting/dog-recruiting-thumbStandard.jpg", "legacy": {"thumbnail": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-recruiting/dog-recruiting-thumbStandard.jpg", "hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailwidth": 75, "thumbnailheight": 75}, "subtype": "thumbnail", "width": 75, "type": "image"}, {"height": 330, "url": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-recruiting/dog-recruiting-articleLarge.jpg", "legacy": {"xlarge": "images/2012/05/06/sports/dog-recruiting/dog-recruiting-articleLarge.jpg", "xlargewidth": 600, "xlargeheight": 330, "hasxlarge": "Y"}, "subtype": "xlarge", "width": 600, "type": "image"}], "pub_date": "2012-05-05T00:00:00Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Sports / College Basketball", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "KLINE, ALEX"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YAHOO!
