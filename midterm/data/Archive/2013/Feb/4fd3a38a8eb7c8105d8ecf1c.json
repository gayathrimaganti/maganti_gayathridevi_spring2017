The play, by Lydia R. Diamond, will end its run at the Cort Theater at a financial loss for the play's producers, who include the pop-R&B singer Alicia Keys (she also composed music for the show). Ticket sales were modest throughout the run of \"Stick Fly,\" which opened on Dec. 8 to mixed reviews from critics; the production has grossed a total of $3.25 million. The capitalization for mounting the show had not been disclosed; most Broadway plays cost between $2 million and $3 million, plus weekly operating expenses. Philip J. Smith, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns the Cort Theater, said that he expected another show to open at the theater before April 26, the cut-off date for eligibility for the 2012 Tony Awards. \"Stick Fly\" is directed by Kenny Leon (\"Fences\") and stars Dul\u00e9 Hill, Mekhi Phifer, Tracie Thoms, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, Rosie Benton, and Condola Rashad, whose performance has been singled out for praise by many critics.", "headline": {"main": "'Stick Fly' to Close at the Cort This Month", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a38a8eb7c8105d8ecf1c", "word_count": 201, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-09T16:30:05Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "Shubert Organization", "rank": "11"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Keys, Alicia", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Theater", "rank": "10"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Hill, Dule", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Diamond, Lydia R", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Phifer, Mekhi", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Rashad, Condola", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Santiago-Hudson, Ruben", "rank": "7"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Smith, Philip J", "rank": "8"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Thoms, Tracie", "rank": "9"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Stick Fly (Play)", "rank": "12"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
