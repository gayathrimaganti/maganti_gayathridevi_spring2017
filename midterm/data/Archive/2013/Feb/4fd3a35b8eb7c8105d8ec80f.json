(The name also follows the label's namesake numerals, in case you didn't notice.) Designed to be unisex, the roomy, fully zipped cowhide carryall can be folded and held as an oversize clutch or expanded and slung over the shoulder. This version here, in not-quite-neon citrus that Lim says reminds him of Pellegrino Limonata, is available exclusively at Barneys. As for the people it brings to mind? \"Everyone,\" Lim says. \"The 3.1 customer is a global person who lives life to the fullest, and I think everyone likes to think of themselves as this person. Don't you?\"", "headline": {"main": "The Get | 3.1 Phillip Lim '31 Hour' Bag", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a35b8eb7c8105d8ec80f", "word_count": 167, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-02T15:18:39Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
