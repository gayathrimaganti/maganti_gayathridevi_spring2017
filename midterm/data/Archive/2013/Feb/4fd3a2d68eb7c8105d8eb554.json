But check out this story from Politico. After the Big 12 Conference chose West Virginia as its newest member, bypassing the University of Louisville, McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, who may well be Louisville's number one fan, is still not on speaking terms with Joe Manchin, a Democrat from-of course!-West Virginia. Why? Because Manchin publicly accused McConnell of interfering with the Big 12's decision, lobbying Big 12 athletic directors to toss West Virginia aside for Louisville. Both schools, I should note, were members of the Big East, the once-great basketball conference, that has been completely sucker punched as schools have raced to join the super-conference that is in the process of taking over college football.
