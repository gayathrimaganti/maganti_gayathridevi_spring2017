The series writer and creator Robert Kirkman's original collaborator, the artist Tony Moore, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. Mr. Moore claims that Mr. Kirkman has not shared the previously agreed-upon amount of royalty or other payments for the properties they created together, which include \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Brit\" and \"Battle Pope.\" The complaint also alleges that, in 2005, Mr. Kirkman fraudulently persuaded Mr. Moore to assign his rights over to a limited liability corporation controlled by Mr. Kirkman, and that he has not provided access to profit statements for the properties.", "headline": {"main": "Graphic Books Best Sellers: A Dispute Over 'Walking Dead' Payments", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2d58eb7c8105d8eb50a", "word_count": 255, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-10T17:35:33Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Suits and Litigation", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Graphic Novels", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kirkman, Robert", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Moore, Tony", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "unknown", "value": "Walking Dead, The (Book)", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
