Comic book series can feel Shakespearean, and Mr. Lee gets a little closer to the source material this week. \"Romeo and Juliet: The War,\" which Mr. Lee co-wrote with Terry Douglas, ends up at No. 7 on both the hardcover and paperback graphic books best-seller lists. The tale is a science-fiction twist on the classic story, as a young boy from the Montague family (who are cyborgs) falls in love with a young girl from the Capulets (who are mutants). How will they survive love?", "headline": {"main": "Graphic Books Best Sellers: Stan Lee Puts a Sci-Fi Twist on Shakespeare", "kicker": "ArtsBeat"}, "_id": "4fd3a2c48eb7c8105d8eb294", "word_count": 412, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-03T14:23:52Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Comic Books and Strips", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Books and Literature", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Lee, Stan", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Archie Comic Publications", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
