Moodie's version was a low ponytail with a disheveled \"post-sex bang,\" created using Bumble and Bumble Prep spray before blow-drying and securing the hair, and wrapping a piece low over the eyes. He recommended Spray de Mode to be sure these bangs are \"light and airy,\" to compliment the '40s-style color-blocked clothes. Charlotte Willer, a makeup artist, chose to channel the graphic looks with Maybelline Eye Studio Gel Eyeliner drawn from the inner corner of the eye up and away onto the skin. She avoided what she called \"just pretty\" '60s cat eyes by leaving space between the line and the lid. There was no mascara and brows were simply groomed. Dream Bouncy cheek color in copper was applied along cheekbones with Baby Lips lip balm. Willer said she was careful to keep it real, \"so a girl can actually walk out onto the street after the show.\"", "headline": {"main": "Backstage Beauty Report | BCBG", "kicker": "T Magazine"}, "_id": "4fd3a35b8eb7c8105d8ec813", "word_count": 180, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-10T08:33:52Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "BCBG", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Cosmetics and Toiletries", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
