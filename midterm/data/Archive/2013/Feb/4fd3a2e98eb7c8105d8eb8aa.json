This is the libertarian version of the \"Two Americas\" slogan that John Edwards made the centerpiece of his now much derided bid for the presidency in 2008. What's different about Murray's analysis is that his villain - largely implicit in the book, but a central presence nonetheless - is the cultural revolution of the 1970s and the consequent relaxation of traditional social restraints, like the disapproval of child-bearing out of wedlock.", "headline": {"main": "What to Read: Meditations on a World Divided", "kicker": "IHT Rendezvous"}, "_id": "4fd3a2e98eb7c8105d8eb8aa", "word_count": 341, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-10T20:50:44Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "Murray, Charles", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Freeland, Chrystia", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Autor, David", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Economic Conditions and Trends", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "McKinsey Quarterly, The", "rank": "6"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
