Ms. Dalayman was scheduled to sing other performances of the opera, the fourth in the \"Ring\" cycle, and will take on Br\u00fcnnhilde in complete cycle runs this spring, alternating with Ms. Voigt. The Met did not elaborate on the nature of Ms. Voigt's illness. At 11:58 p.m. on Monday night, Ms. Voigt sent a Twitter message saying simply, \"Hostess Twinkies.
