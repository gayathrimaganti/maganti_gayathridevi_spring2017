It's worth watching. The subject is animal suffering in the leather industry and the risks to human health and the environment from tanneries. Ms. McCartney, who doesn't use animal skins in her fashion, has worked with PETA in previous campaigns; at Chlo\u00e9, in the late '90s, she appeared in a video that drew attention to animal suffering in the fur industry. Her bags and shoes, which are made from non-leather materials, have quietly and steadily gained a following. Indeed, accessories have become a substantial business for her company.", "headline": {"main": "Stella McCartney's Fashion Message", "kicker": "On the Runway"}, "_id": "4fd3a31f8eb7c8105d8ebf29", "word_count": 243, "multimedia": [], "pub_date": "2012-02-06T12:57:20Z", "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": null, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "Fashion and Apparel", "rank": "4"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Cruelty to Animals", "rank": "3"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "McCartney, Stella", "rank": "2"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Fur", "rank": "5"}, {"name": "type_of_material", "value": "News", "rank": "1"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Leather and Leather Goods", "rank": "6"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals", "rank": "7"}], "blog": [], "subsection_name": null, "type_of_material": "Blog"}
