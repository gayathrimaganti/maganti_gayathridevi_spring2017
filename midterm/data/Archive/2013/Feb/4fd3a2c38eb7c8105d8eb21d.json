Made of basics that all pair easily with each other, the 12-piece collection features cropped neon-tangerine pants (\"that's a good, bright color to wear on stage,\" she says), black, brown and snakeskin boots, a soft leather jacket and T-shirts printed with Gordon's own illustrations. \"I like balancing things.
