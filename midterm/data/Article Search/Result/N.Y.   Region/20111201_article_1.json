Despite her many roles as a ragingly successful business entrepreneur, divorced mother of three sons and devoted stepmother to three daughters, crack skier and tennis ace, adored friend, philanthropist, consummate hostess and general woman about town, she is disconcertingly all of a piece. There is - but how can this be? Can Dostoyevsky be all wrong? - no lurking secret self, no rattling skeletons.

And what you get, as far as I can tell, having spent some time with her and having talked to numerous people about her, is someone annoyingly close to perfect. Someone it would be nice to dislike, if she were only dislikable. Someone it's impossible not to envy, if only because her life seems sun drenched from the get-go, with a childhood that sounds near magical, spent climbing trees and romping with her brothers and the German shepherds her parents bred on a 35-acre gentleman's farm in Valley Forge, Pa., replete with tennis court and swimming pool.", "type_of_material": "Blog", "print_page": null, "section_name": "T:Style", "news_desk": null, "abstract": "When they made Tory Burch - gorgeous, successful, smart, loving - they forgot the flaws.
