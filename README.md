### Feedback:
- Good work. Please do not give up when facing problems, Hari and me are always here to help!
- Question 2: Only 26 characters should appear in the result. Punctuations should be removed.
- Question 4: find() function will not return the right elements. And try to use loop to go through the files not manually do it.
- Question 5: upper/lower case should be considered.
